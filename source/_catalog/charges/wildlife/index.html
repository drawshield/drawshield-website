<p>Drawshield was originally targetted at British Heraldry, hence there is a good range of British Wildlife represented.</p>

<p>In addition to these there are are many other types of realistic animal available, including <a href="/catalog/charges/livestock/index.html">livestock and farm animals</a>, <a href="/catalog/charges/dog/index.html">dogs</a> and  <a href="/catalog/charges/animal/index.html">other recognisable animals</a> from other parts of the world.</p>
