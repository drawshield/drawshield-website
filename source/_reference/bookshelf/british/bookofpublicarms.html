<p>This is the essential reference for all arms that belong to entities other than families. There is a brief introduction and then a simple alphabetical list of entries, the majority with clear illustrations. Available from archive.org in a text-searchable PDF and other formats at <a href="http://archive.org/details/bookofpublicarms00foxd">http://archive.org/details/bookofpublicarms00foxd</a>.</p>

<p>Good scan quality, almost all pages clearly readable, image quality good to excellent. OCR accuracy 95%+</p>

<p>NOTES: The edition linked to here is of excellent quality but is missing pages 761 and 762. These contain entries for <strong>The Royal College of Surgeons, Surrey, Sussex West and Sussex</strong>. There is an alternative version of the same work at <a href="http://archive.org/details/cu31924029798927">http://archive.org/details/cu31924029798927</a> which is not of such good quality (centre of double page spreads obscured in places) but it <em>does</em> contain the missing pages.</p>
