<p><strong>Encyclopaedia Heraldica, or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry</strong>, William BERRY, Sherwood Gilbert and Piper, 1828-40??</p>

<img class="img-fluid"src="img/encyclopaediaher01berr.png"/>

<p>Reasonably clear reproduction of a very comprehensive work, although it can be difficult to find things, printed page numbers are rare and the contents page does not show page numbers anyway. Family names are scattered in several different sections and addenda. Despite this, there is a potentially useful cross reference sections that links ordinaries and charges with family names, e.g. you can answer questions such as "which armigers have a chevron sable"?</p>

<p>Fully text searchable, OCR accuracy 95%+, some pages and especially the plates in Volume III are quite faded.</p>

<p>To assist in using this work I have created a new table of contents, the numbers below being the PDF version page numbers. (Note volume II has a slightly different file name structure)</p>
