<img class="img-fluid"src="img/treatiseonherald01wood.png"/>

<p>Slightly long-winded but interesting description of the history and development of heraldry, followed by many examples of charges and ordinaries, then quite a wide ranging discussion of further topics in volume II. 60+ Plates, many in colour but largely showing shields only, and fairly simple ones. Very good, clear reproduction. Fully text searchable, OCR accuracy 98%+.
