<h1>Abeyance</h1>
<p>Abeyance. The expectancy of a title ; the right being in existance, but the exercise of it suspended. </p>
<p>On the death of a baron, whose dignity originated in a Writ of Summons, without issuemale, the barony becomes vested in his daughters ; if he leaves an only daughter, she succeeds to the dignity, but if there be more daughters than one, the title falls into Abeyance amongst them, and continues in that state until all but one of the daughters, or the sole heir of only one daughter survives ; in which case, the barony devolves on the surviving daughter, or on the heir of her body. The Crown can, however, at any time, terminate an Abeyance in favour of one of the heirs.  </p>
