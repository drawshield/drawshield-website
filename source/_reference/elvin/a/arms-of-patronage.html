<h1>Arms of Patronage</h1>
<p>Arms of Patronage. Are of two kinds. First they consist of part of the arms of those lords, of whom the persons bearing them held in fee ; either adding to the paternal arms of the person assuming such additions ; or borne as feudal arms, to show the dependance of the parties bearing them on their particular Lord. Secondly, they are such as Governors of provinces. Lords of Manors, etc. add to their family arms.  </p>
