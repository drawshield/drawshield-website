    THE aim of the present work is not to furnish an account of the
    antiquity and progress of Heraldry, but to provide as succinctly as possibly, and in Alphabetical order,
    a list of the terms met with in the Science, with their appropriate Illustrations.
</p>

<p>
    Such a work it is hoped will he of great advantage to the Herald Painter and Engraver, as by means of it they 
    will he enabled to refer, without trouble, to the subject they may desire to depict.
</p>

<p>
    I propose, therefore, in the first place, to give the terms in a plain and concise form, 
    so that any coat which is in strict conformity with the established rules of
    Heraldry, may easily be painted or engraved from the verbal Blazoning.
</p>

<p>
    Secondly, I hope by the introduction of a great number of terms and Engravings, not to be found in any
    other Heraldic Glossary, to supply as complete a list as possible of those used in Coat Armour, and thus 
    adapt the work not alone for the
    Practical Artist, but also for the Amateur, who desires to be able readily to blazon 
    such coats as may fall under his observation.
