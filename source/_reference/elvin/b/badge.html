<h1>Badge</h1>
<p>Badge. A device, anciently placed on banners, ensigns, caparisons, and liveries; but it fell into disuse in the reign of Queen Elizabeth with the rest of the brilliant relics of the feudal system. </p>
<p>The Badge is never placed on a wreath, andthe few families who still use it, have it either depicited below the shield ; or if they bear two, one is placed on either side of the crest.  </p>
