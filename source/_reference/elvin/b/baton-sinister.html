<h1>Baton Sinister</h1>
<p>Baton Sinister, Baston, Batton, Battoon, Batune. Also termed a Fissure. A mark of illegitimacy, is a diminutive of the bend sinister, being one fourth its breadth. It does not extend from side to side of the shield ; and may be borne either plain or charged. See <a href="../plate19.html">P.  19,</a>  f. 27. </p>
<p>The Baton has been adopted since the fifteenth century, in England, to mark theillegitimate descendants of the Eoj'al Family only ; before which time no jDositive rule prevailed, since the more ancient ways of marking illegitimacy were by the Bend, either jjlacing the Father's arms thereon or debruising them by it ; the Border was also used as a mark of bastardy.  </p>
