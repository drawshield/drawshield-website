<h1>Clarion</h1>
<p>Clarion, Sufflue, Claricord, or Rest. <a href="../plate43.html">P.  43,</a>  f. 27 and 28. </p>
<p>This is by some supposed to denote the restfor the lance, but this cannot be the case as Clarions are found in armoury b if ore the rest for the lance was invented. In fact the very name sufflue, and clarion, point to some kind of wind instrument.  </p>
