<h1>Escutcheon</h1>
<p>Escutcheon, Escusson, Escocheon, or Escu. The shield with the arms painted on it, in opposition to the Ecu which was a shield without device. The shield may be of any shape, but the oldest escutcheons are like a Gothic arch reversed, and are called the Roman or Heater shield. <a href="../plate8.html">P.  8,</a>  f. 21. </p>
<p>The surface of the escutcheon or shield istermed the Field, because it contains those marks of honour which were formerly acquired in the Field. These shields are of every imaginable shape, according to the fancy of the bearer, the only restriction now being that Ladies must bear their Arms in a Lozenge. <a href="../plate9.html">P.  9,</a>  f. 21 ; and <a href="../plate22.html">P  22,</a>  f. 21. </p>
<p>The Escutcheon has certain points, distinguished for the place of the charges whichthe field contains. (See Points of Escutcheon. <a href="../plate1.html">P.  1</a>  ) It is also frequently divided by Lines, called either Partition lines, or Crooked lines, the former are known by the term Party, and of these there are seven, viz. : Party per Chevron, Party per Fesse, Party per Pale, Party per Cross, Party per Saltire, Party per Bend, and Party per Bend Sinister, usually blazoned Per Chevron, Per Fesse, etc. See <a href="../plate2.html">P.  2.</a>  </p>
<p>The Crooked Lines most commonly met withare nine, called Engrailed, Invecked, Wavy, Nebule, Imbattled, or Embattled, Raguly, Indented, Dancettee, and Dovetail ; there are, however, many more iTsed in Heraldry, but which are of rare occurrence. See <a href="../plate1.html">P.  1.</a>  Escutcheon of Pretence. Is a shield on which a man carries the arms of his wife, when she is an Heiress, or Co-Heiress.
