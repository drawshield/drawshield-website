<h1>Fountain</h1>
<p>Fountain, Syke, or Well. Terms which are always applied to a roundle barry wavy of six ar. and az. as at <a href="../plate1.html">P.  1.</a>  </p>
<p>These should now be blazoned " Heraldicfountains," in order to distinguish themfrom Modern Fountains, which have been introduced into Coat Armour, and which are generally borne playing. In the latter, the number of basins should be named; in a modern grant a fountain is depicted. <a href="../plate42.html">P.  42,</a>  f. 55.  </p>
