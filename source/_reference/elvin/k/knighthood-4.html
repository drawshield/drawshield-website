<h1>Knighthood</h1>
<p>Knighthood, The Most Honourable Order of the Bath. The Order of the Bath was probably instituted by King Henry IV , 1399, although Selden and Ashmole are of opinion that the said King did not institute, but rather revive it. After the coronation of Charles II., the Order was neglected until the year 1725, when George I. revived and remodelled it. However, several alterations have since been made, and on the second day of January, 1815, it was enlarged and divided into three classes, in commemoration of " the auspicious termination of the long and arduous contest in which this empire has been engaged." On the 14th April, 1847, it was further increased by the addition of Civil Divisions of the second and third classes, when new Statutes were made for the Government of the Order, which have since been revised and the Order now consists of the following members, viz. : </p>
<p>1st Class Knight's Grand Cross for themilitary service, fifty, exclusive of the Sovereign and princes of the blood royal, and such distinguished foreigners as may be nominated Honorary Knights Grand Cross, and twenty. five for the Civil Service. By Eoyal Warrant, 2nd June, 1725, all Knights Grand Cross are entitled to a grant of supporters. </p>
<p>2nd Class Knight's Commanders for themilitary service, one hundred and twentythree, and for the civil service eighty, exclusive of foreign officers, who may be admitted as Honorary Knights Commanders. In the event of actions of signal distinction, or of future wars, the numbers of this, as well as of the third class, may be increased. The members of the second class are entitled to the distinctive appellation of Knighthood, after having been invested with the Insignia. </p>
<p>3rd Class Companions of the Order sixhundred and ninety, and for the Civil Service two hundred and fifty ; they take precedence of Esquires, but are not entitled to the appellation or style of Knights. No officer can be nominated to the military division of the third class of the Order, unless his services have been marked by special mention of his name as having distinguished himself in action against the enemy. This class has never been conferred upon any officer below the rank of Major in the Army, and Commander in the Navy. </p>
