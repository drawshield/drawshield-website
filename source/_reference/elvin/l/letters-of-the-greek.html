<h1>Letters of the Greek</h1>
<p>Letters of the Greek, Hebrew, Roman, Text, and other Alphabets are borne in Coat Armour, either singly, or in words, e.g. The Greek Alpha A and 9. Omega form part of the arms of the Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge ; and the Professor of Hebrew has the Hebrew letter Hhet D. See Upsilon, etc. </p>
<p>" The text &real; pierced through with adash in the centre in the arms of Battle Abbey." </p>
<p>" Now though i have read letters to be littlehonourable in arms, this cannot be disgraceful, partly because Church-Heraldry moves in a sphere by itself, partly because this was the letter of letters, as the received character to signify Christus." Fuller's Church History, vol. ii. <a href="../plate27.html">p.  227.</a>   </p>
