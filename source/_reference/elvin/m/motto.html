<h1>Motto</h1>
<p>Motto, or mot. A word or saying added to the Arms, placed in a scroll, eit'ner under the shield, or above the crest, and sometimes in both places. <a href="../plate11.html">P.  11,</a>  f. 21, and <a href="../plate47.html">P.  47.</a>  </p>
<p>The motto is of universal use among allnobility and gentry. It does not exclusively belong to Heraldry, and is not hereditary, but may be taken, varied, or relinquished at pleasure. Still there is a pride in using a time honoured sentiment, particularly when it is commemorative of soiae deed of chivalry. Mottoes are for the most part either in Latin or French ; but they are met with in Hebrew, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Welsh, Irish, Scotch, etc. See Elviu's Handbook of Mottoes.  </p>
