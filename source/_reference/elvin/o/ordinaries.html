<h1>Ordinaries</h1>
<p>Ordinaries. So called because they are the most ancient and common amongst the various cognizances used in Heraldry, are divided (although on this point the opinions of Heralds are greatly at variance) into the honourable and subordinaries, which are all subject to the accidental forms of the lines composing them, as engrailed, invecked, etc., etc. The honourable ordinaries according to the present practice should always occupy one third of the field, and are the Bend, Bend Sinister, Chevron, Chief, Cross, Fesse, Pale, Quarter, and Saltier, which, with their diminutives, will be found under their proper heads. </p>
<p>All ordinaries may be charged ; 1.e , havefigures upon them, their diminutives should not, but in many shields they are charged with figures. See [Diminutives].  </p>
