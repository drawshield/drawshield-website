Sometimes one plume is placed above another, it is then termed either a double plume, or a plume of two heights. If composed of three rows, one above the other, it is termed a triple plume, or a plume of thi-oe heights, and should be composed of twelve feathers, of which five are placed in the bottom row, four in the next, and three in the top row.
