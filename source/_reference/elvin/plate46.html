The Husbands arms are quarterly,

<li>A Widow 
When a Widow marries a second 
time, her husband impales her 
paternal arms. If a Peer marries 
an untitled lady and he die leaving 
lier a widow, and she marry for 
her second husband an untitled 
gentleman, there is an absurd 
fashion of bearing the Heraldic 
Insignia the same as if she was a 
Peeress in her own right </li>

second House is a crescent charged 
with a label. The eldest son of 
the third House, a mullet, charged 
with a label, etc. See also <a href="plate16.html">Plate
