<p>The Quaterfoil was an imitation of thepiiuirose, which being one of the first flowers of the spring, was considered as the harbinger of revivified nature, and was adopted by the church architects to signify, emblematically, that the gospel, the harbinger of peace and immortality, was there preached. The Trefoil was the emblem of the Trinity.  </p>
