<h1>Quintin</h1>
<p>Quintin, or Quintal. An upright pole with a cross beam onthe top, which works on a pivot. At one end cf the cross beam is a shield painted with rings, and at the other end is a log of wood, suspended by a stout chain. Men on horseback tilted at the shield, and unless they passed very quickly were struck by the log as the beam revolved. <a href="../plate37.html">P.  37,</a>  f. S9  </p>
