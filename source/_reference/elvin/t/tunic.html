<h1>Tunic</h1>
<p>Tunic, Tunique, or Tabard. The surcoat worn by heralds and other officers of Arms distinguished by the general name of Tabard ; but the tabard of a King of Arms is properly called a Tunique ; tliat of a Herald, a Placque ; and that worn by a Pursuivant, a Coat-of.Arms. All were alike, emblazoned with the Arms of the Sovereign or Noble whom the wearer served, and for this reason a surcoat was also termed ' Houce des Amies.'  </p>
