<h1>Accosted</h1>
<p>Accosted, (fr. accost&eacute;): 1. a term used when <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> are placed on each side of another charge, as, a pale accosted by six mullets; though English heralds would generally say, between six mullets pallet-wise. 2. Applied to two beasts walking or running side by side. Unless they are accosted passant counter-passant the more distant should be a little in advance of the other.</p>
<blockquote>
