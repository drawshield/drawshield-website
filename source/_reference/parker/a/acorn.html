<h1>Acorn</h1>
<p>Acorn, (fr. gland, old fr. cheyne): this is usually represented <a  href="../v/vert.html">vert</a>, but they may be of other colours. They may also be <a  href="../s/slipped.html">slipped</a> or leaved. An acorn-sprig is not unfrequently used in the arms, and is often used also as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a>. Sometimes, too, the acorn-cups are represented alone.</p>
