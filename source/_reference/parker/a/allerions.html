<h1>Allerions</h1>
<p>Allerions, (fr. al&eacute;rions): resembling <a  href="../e/eaglets.html">eaglets</a> <a  href="../d/displayed.html">displayed</a>, but without beak or feet, and the points of the wings downward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three allerions displayed or--LIMESEY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, on a bend gules, three allerions argent--Duchy of LORRAINE.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">[These arms are supposed to have originated from the circumstance of Godfrey of Boulogne, duke of Lorraine, shooting three allerions with an arrow from a tower of Jerusalem "upon the direction of a prophetick person." A far more probable supposition is, that the arms were intended as a play upon the name of the duchy.]</p>
