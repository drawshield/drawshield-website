<p>Angles: this bearing seems intended to represent the hook or fastening of a waistband(the arms of Wastley being allusive), and for this purpose the rings are attached; possibly for the same purpose, namely, that it might serve as a dress fastening, rings were attached to the Cross annuletty. This charge might be described also as two chevrons interlaced and couped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three pairs of Angles interlaced fesswise; at each end an annulet azure--WASTLEY.</p>
