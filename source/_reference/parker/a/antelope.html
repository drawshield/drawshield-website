<p>Antelope: it is now customary with herald-painters to draw animals as they appear naturally, which is, generally speaking, directly contrary to the practice of ancient artists, who drew them conventionally. Hence arises the distinction between the heraldic antelope and the natural. The form of the <a href="../a/antelope.html">antelope</a>, as drawn by the old heralds, has a mane and long tail, and differs considerably from the fawn-like appearance of the animal in nature. Antelopes' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> are also frequently named, and both the animal and the head appear among the crests. The <a href="../a/antelope.html">antelope</a> <a  href="../g/gorged.html">gorged</a> with a <a  href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> occurs amongst the badges of Henry V., and with an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a  href="../c/collar.html">collar</a> with <a  href="../c/chain.html">chain</a> attached amongst those of Henry VI.</p>

<p class="blazon">With the heraldic Antelope must be grouped the <a  href="../i/ibex.html">Ibex</a>, which resembles it, although belonging to the goat-tribe.</p>
