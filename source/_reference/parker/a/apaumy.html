<h1>Apaumy</h1>
<p>Apaumy, or Appalmed, (fr. appaum&eacute;): said of a <a  href="../h/hand.html">hand</a> open, shewing the palm. The term is, however, scarcely necessary, as every hand not blazoned as <a href="../a/aversant.html">aversant</a>, or <a  href="../d/dorsed.html">dorsed</a>, is supposed to be appalmed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Vert, an arrow fesswise in chief and a dexter hand apaumy couped in base argent--LOUGHMAN, Ireland.</p>
</blockquote>
