<p>Argent, (fr.): the tincture Silver. By those who emblazon according to the Planetary system it is represented by the <a  href="../m/moon.html">Moon</a>, just as the <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> of <a  href="../g/gold.html">gold</a> is represented by the <a  href="../s/sun.html">Sun</a>. Hence it is sometimes fancifully called <a  href="../l/luna.html">Luna</a> in the arms of princes, as also <a  href="../p/pearl.html">Pearl</a> in those of peers. As silver soon becomes tarnished, it is generally represented in painting by white. In engraving it is known by the natural colour of the paper; and in tricking by the letter a. In the <a  href="../d/doubling.html">doubling</a> of <a  href="../m/mantle.html">mantles</a> it may be called <a  href="../w/white.html">white</a>, because(as the old heralds say) it is not in that case to be taken for a <a  href="../m/metal.html">metal</a>, but the skin of a little beast called a Litvite. Sometimes, too, in old rolls of arms the term <a  href="../b/blanc.html">blanc</a> is used.</p>
