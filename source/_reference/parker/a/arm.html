<h1>Arm</h1>
<p>Arm, (fr. bras, but usually dextrochere or senestrochere, q.v.): the human arm is often found as part of a crest, although it is not very frequent as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>. It should be carefully described as being dexter or sinister; <a  href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>, <a  href="../e/embowed.html">embowed</a>, or counter-embowed; vested, vambraced, armed, or naked, as the case may be: sometimes it is cuffed. If couped, care should be taken to describe where. When <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a> at the elbow, it is called a <a  href="../c/cubit-arm.html">cubit-arm</a>. When <a href="../a/armed.html">armed</a> the metal-plates for the elbow are termed <a  href="../b/brassarts.html">brassarts</a>.</p>
