<h1>Armed</h1>
<p>Armed, (fr. arm&eacute;): when any beast of prey has teeth and claws, or any beast of chase(except stags, &amp;c.) horns and hoofs, or any bird of prey beak and talons, of a tincture different from its body, it is said to be armed of such a tincture, though, as regards hoofs, hoofed, or unguled(fr. ongl&eacute;), is the more accurate term. The <a  href="../l/lion.html">lion</a> is usually langued of the same <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a>. The application to beasts and birds of prey is because their talons are to them weapons of defence.</p>
