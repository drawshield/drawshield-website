<h1>Armour</h1>
<p>Armour: the grants of coats of arms having been of old frequently for services rendered in the battle-field it is but natural that portions of the armour should at times form devices emblazoned on the shields, and be used for <a  href="../c/crest.html">Crests</a>. The <a  href="../h/helmet.html">Helmet</a>, for instance, besides being an appendage to the shield, became a charge, and was represented differently, besides which there were several varieties of <a  href="../m/metal.html">metal</a> head-coverings, such as the <a  href="../c/cap.html">Cap</a> of Steel, the Bassinet, the Burgonet, and the Morion, all different from the esquire's <a  href="../h/helmet.html">helmet</a>, which was that usually represented. The <a  href="../h/hauberk.html">hauberk</a> and the habergeon, as well as the <a  href="../c/cuirass.html">cuirass</a>, or <a  href="../b/breast-plate.html">breastplate</a>, are found as bearings. So also <a href="../a/armour.html">armour</a> and brassarts for the arm, gauntlets for the hand, and greaves for the leg occur. We find a "Man in Armour," or, as he may be termed, a Chevalier, and this last is often employed as a 'supporter.' To describe all the various portions of armour, and their several names at different periods, would be beyond the limits of this work, though in its origin Heraldry, as the "Science of Armoury," is intimately associated with the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Vert, a horse thereon a man in complete armour, in the dexter hand a sword proper--MAGUIRE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a chevalier in full armour with halbert proper--ARGANOR.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a demi-chevalier in plate armour, couped at the thighs proper, holding in his dexter hand a battle-axe--HALFHEAD.</p>
<p class="blazon">A man on horseback in full speed, armed cap-a-pie, and bearing on his left arm his shield charged with the arms of France and England quarterly; on his helmet a cap of maintenance; thereon a lion statant guardant ducally crowned; his dexter arm extended and holding a sword erect, the pomel whereof is fastened to a chain which passes from the gorget; the horse fully caparisoned--Seal of the Town of WALLINGFORD.</p>
<p class="blazon">A man in armour also borne by families of MONCURRE, ANSTROTHER, ARMSDRESSER, O'LOGHLEN, GRIMSDITCH, NEVOY, &amp;c.</p>
