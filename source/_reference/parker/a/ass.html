<h1>Ass</h1>
<p>Ass, (fr. &acirc;ne): this animal in theoretical heraldry is emblematical of patience, but appears mainly to be used in arms as punning upon the name. The <a  href="../m/mule.html">Mule</a> is sometimes named, (but erroneously in arms of MOYLE. See under <a  href="../b/bull.html">Bull</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, an ass argent--ASSIL.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse between three asses passant sable--ASKEWE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a fesse between three asses passant argent--AYSCOUGH, Bp. of Salisbury, 1438-50.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an ass's head erased sable--HOLKNELL.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, an ass(or mule) passant within a border argent--MOYLE, Kent.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a fesse ermine between three mules passant argent--STOMPE, Berks.</p>
