<h1>Attire</h1>
<p>Attire, (fr. ramure): may be used for a single horn of a stag. Both the <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> are commonly called a <a  href="../s/stag.html">stag's</a> <a href="../a/attire.html">attires</a>(sometimes written <a  href="../t/tires.html">tires</a>), and are generally borne affixed to the scalp(fr. massacr&eacute;). The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> <a href="../a/attire.html">attired</a>(fr. <a  href="../c/cheville.html">chevill&eacute;</a> and ram&eacute;) is used when <a  href="../s/stag.html">stags</a> and some other beasts, e.g. <a  href="../g/goat.html">goats</a>, are spoken of, because it is supposed that their horns are given them as ornaments, and not as weapons. The main stem of the antler is termed the <a  href="../b/beam.html">beam</a>.</p>
