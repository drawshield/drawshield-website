<h1>Auk</h1>
<p>Auk, (lat. alca): this bird occurs in the following arms, and as in another blazoning of the same <a href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> the term <a  href="../m/murr.html">murr</a> occurs instead of <a href="../a/auk.html">auk</a>, we may presume that it is synonymous. The name <a  href="../r/razorbill.html">Razor-bill</a>(alca torda) also occurs on one coats of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a chevron sable between three auks(or murrs) proper--CARTHEU, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, the head of an auk proper--AUKES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three razor-bill's heads, couped sable--BRUNSTAUGH.</p>
