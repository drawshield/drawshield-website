<p>Azure, bright blue, i.e. the <a  href="../c/colours.html">colour</a> of an eastern sky, probably derives the name from the Arabic lazura(conf. lapis lazuli, Gr. <img src="../img/greek01.png" alt="lazorion" class="align-center">, Span. azul, Italian azurro, Fr. azur), the name being introduced from the East at the time of the Crusades. It is sometimes called <a  href="../i/inde.html">Inde</a> from the sapphire, which is found in the East: (see example under <a  href="../c/cadency.html">cadency</a>.) Heralds who blazon by planets called it Jupiter, perhaps from his supposed rule over the skies; and when the names of jewels are employed it is called <a  href="../s/sapphire.html">Sapphire</a>. Engravers represent it by an indefinite number of horizontal line.</p>
