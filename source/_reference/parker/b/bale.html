<p>Bale, or bag: a package of merchandise corded: one containing silk occurs in the arms of the Company of SILKMEN, while a bag of madder occurs in that of the DYERS. Madder was a plant, much used in dyeing, and is named but in this one instance. It is to be noted especially that the cords are of a different tincture from the rest. The <a href="../b/bale.html">bale</a>, or bag, is to be distinguished from the bundle, or hank(e.g. of <a  href="../c/cotton.html">cotton</a>, <a  href="../s/silk.html">silk</a>, &amp;c.)</p>
<blockquote>
