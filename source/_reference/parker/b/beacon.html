<p>Beacon, (A.-Sax. becn, fr. phare): an iron cage or trived, containing blazing material, placed upon a lofty pole served to guide travellers; or to alarm the neighbourhood in case of an invasion or rebellion. The <a  href="../c/cresset.html">cressets</a>, or lights anciently used in the streets of London were similar in form.</p>
