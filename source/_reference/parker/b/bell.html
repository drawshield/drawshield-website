<p>Bell, (fr. cloche), or as it is sometimes called a <a  href="../c/church-bell.html">Church bell</a>, is a large bell of the usual form. Smaller bells of a different shape are attached to the legs of hawks and falcons, q.v., when they are said to be belled; also to necks of bulls, &amp;c. (fr. clarin&eacute;).</p>
<p class="blazon">When the <a  href="../c/clapper.html">clapper</a> is of a different tincture it is to be so described(fr. bataill&eacute;). The <a  href="../c/cannon.html">cannon</a> or ear may be also of a different tincture from the body or barrel of the bell.</p>
