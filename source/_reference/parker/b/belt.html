<p>Belt: this charge is but rarely borne, and usually only a small portion of the leather is shewn(as in the margin); hence it is often blazoned half a belt, and the buckles(fr. boucle) should be named as to position, tincture, &amp;c. The <a href="../b/belt.html">belt</a> worn over the shoulder, and crossing the chest and back, was termed anciently a baldrich or baudrick, and to the lower part was attached the sword. It is not borne by this name, but has been said, amongst other suppositions, to have been the origin of the bend.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="blazon">Gules, two pieces of belts[otherwise half-belts] palewise, in fesse, argent, the buckles erect in chief or--PELHAM.</p>
