<h1>Bishop</h1>
<p>Bishop: In <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> times the bishops and other ecclesiastics frequently took a vigorous part in military affairs, and hence in the insignia borne by sees and by religious houses the ordinary military charges appear. In modern times the Mitre(q.v.) has taken the place of the helmet and crest upon all episcopal arms. The <a href="../b/bishop.html">bishop</a> impales the arms of the see with his paternal coat, the former on the dexter, the latter on the sinister side. (See <a  href="../a/achievements.html">Achievements</a> and Marshalling.)</p>
<p class="blazon">A figure of a bishop, also in his pontifical vestments, occurs in the arms of the see of CLOGHER, as well as in those of some of the Scotch sees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a bishop[some say S.Michael] mitred and vested standing in the porch of a church, the dexter hand elevated praying over a cauldron on a fire, and containing three children all proper; in his sinister hand a crozier or--See of ABERDEEN.</p>
