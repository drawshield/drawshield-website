<h1>Boar</h1>
<p>Boar: this word implies the wild-boar, and occurs perhaps more frequently in Scottish than in English coats of arms. It was called with the old heralds sanglier. A young wild-boar is termed a <a  href="../g/grice.html">Grice</a>, and is borne by families of that name. The term <a  href="../m/marcassin.html">Marcassin</a> is also used for a young wild-boar, and this should be represented with <a  href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> hanging down, instead of twisted. The term <a  href="../h/hog.html">Hog</a> and Porc are also employed.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../b/boar.html">boar</a>, besides being represented in the various ways common to other animals, e.g. <a  href="../p/passant.html">passant</a>, <a  href="../r/rampant.html">rampant</a>, <a  href="../s/statant.html">statant</a>, &amp;c., may be represented <a  href="../e/enraged.html">enraged</a>. It may also be represented <a  href="../c/crined.html">crined</a>, tusked, cleyed, membered, unguled, armed, bristled, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="blazon">More frequently the heads(fr. hure) were borne than the whole animal, and are represented as lying lengthways, unless expressed otherwise. The <a  href="../s/snout.html">snout</a>(fr. boutoi) is in some French arms of a different tincture. It should be stated whether the heads are couped or erased.</p>
