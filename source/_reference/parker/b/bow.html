<h1>Bow</h1>
<p>Bow, (fr. Arc): the long-bow, hand-bow, or string-bow, and the cross-bow(fr. arbalette), as well as <a  href="../a/arrow.html">arrows</a>, are of frequent occurrence in coat-armour. In one case the term <a  href="../s/stone-bow.html">stone-bow</a> occurs, in allusion to the name; in another, an antique-bow. Their position should be mentioned, and also whether they are strung of a different tincture. The bowstring also occurs alone.</p>
