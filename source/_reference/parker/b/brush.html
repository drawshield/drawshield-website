<p>Brush, (fr. brosse): the block-brush is perhaps the most important; it represents a bunch of the herb called knee-holm, or sometimes <a  href="../k/knee-holly.html">knee-holly</a>(the <a  href="../k/knee-holly.html">knee-holy</a> of monastic, and ruscus of modern botanists), used by butchers to clean their blocks, hence called butcher's <a href="../b/broom.html">broom</a>. It is borne in the insignia of BUTCHERS' Company, q.v. under Slaughter-axe, but has often been drawn as a <a  href="../g/garbe.html">garbe</a> or wheatsheaf.</p>
<a id="079"></a><p class="blazon">The <a href="../b/besom.html">Besom</a> is also found mentioned, and a flat-brush(such as is used by whitewashers) is borne in the arms of the PLASTERERS' Company. See <a  href="../h/hammer.html">Hammer</a>.</p>
