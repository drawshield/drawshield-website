<h1>Bush</h1>
<p>Bush: the simple term 'bushes' occurs, but the flaming or burning bush is the most striking form. The latter is borne differently, as will be seen, by different branches of the BRANDER family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, from behind bushes vert, a stag courant argent, on a chief azure three castles of the field one and two--JAMES, Brecknock.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a flaming bush on the top of a mount proper, between three lions rampant argent, in the flanks two roses of the last--BRANDER, Elgin.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a burning bush proper between two roses argent in fesse, in chief two lions rampant, and a third in base of the last--BRANDER, Surrey.</p>
