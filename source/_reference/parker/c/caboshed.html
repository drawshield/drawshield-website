<h1>Caboshed</h1>
<p>Caboshed, Cabossed, or Caboched, otherwise Trunked(old fr. caboche): terms applied to the <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> of <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a>, when borne full-faced and with no part of the neck being visible, so that it appears like the marks of a head. An example will be seen above, under <a  href="../b/bull.html">bull</a>, also under <a  href="../l/leopard.html">leopard</a>: in the case of leopards' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>, however, as the <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> is not found used, it does not appear to be necessary. The term <a  href="../r/rencontre.html">rencontre</a> supplies the nearest equivalent in French heraldry; thus arms here figured would be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> in French rencontre de cerf.</p>
