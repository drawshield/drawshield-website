<p>Candlestick, (fr. chandelier). The taper-candlestick, borne in the arms of the FOUNDERS' Company, and usually drawn as represented in the annexed engraving, has a spike, or, as it is technically termed, a picket, upon which the taper is placed. Vide also <a  href="../m/mortcour.html">Mortcour</a>, which is used at funerals.</p>
