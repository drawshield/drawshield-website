<h1>Caparison</h1>
<p>Caparison, or housing(old fr. barde): the embroidered covering of a horse, which was often charged with the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of the <a  href="../k/knights.html">knight</a> to whom the horse belonged, as on the seal of Edward CROUCHBACK, Earl of Lancaster. The <a  href="../h/horse.html">horse</a> represented upon his monument, and that of Aymer DE VALENCE, both in Westminster Abbey, are examples of the practice. The <a  href="../h/horse.html">horses</a> upon the great seals of King Edward I. and many of his successors are caparisoned with the royal arms.</p>
<a id="094"></a><p class="blazon">All animals embroidered upon the housing of a horse should face his <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a>. The same they be said of all charges which are different on each side; thus a bend upon the right side of the caparison of a horse would appear as a <a  href="../b/bend-sinister.html">bend sinister</a>.</p>
