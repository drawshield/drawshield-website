<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/094a.png" alt="CASTILE." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">CASTILE.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Castle, (fr. chateau): the word castle used alone generally signifies either a single Tower, q.v. or two towers with a <a  href="../g/gate.html">gate</a> between them. A <a href="../c/castle.html">castle</a> <a  href="../t/triple-towered.html">triple-towered</a> is represented in the ensign of the kingdom of CASTILE, and is frequently found <a  href="../q/quartered.html">quartered</a> in the arms of Queen Eleanor. The illustration is from glass still existing in Dorchester Church, Oxon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a lion rampant sable, quartering gules, a castle triple-towered or--CASTILE and LEON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three castles triple-towered within the royal tressure argent--Burgh of ABERDEEN.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a castle triple-towered or--TOWERS, Bp. of Peterborough, 1639-49.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="095"></a><p class="blazon">Amongst other varieties which occur, are triangular and quadrangular castles; <a href="../c/castle.html">castles</a> seen in perspective, and castles extending quite across the field. Castles are also described as <a  href="../d/domed.html">domed</a>, <a  href="../t/turret.html">turreted</a>(fr. <a  href="../d/donjonne.html">donjonn&eacute;</a>), embattled, breached, &amp;c., and it is not uncommon to describe in detail towers, gates, loopholes, windows, vanes, portcullises, and the like. Where the masonry is shewn by the addition of lines the term <a  href="../m/masoned.html">masoned</a> is used. The <a  href="../w/windows.html">windows</a> and doors are sometimes represented as of a different tincture, and then are supposed to be closed; and the same if they are of that of the castle itself; but if of the tincture of the field they are supposed to be open, and the term <a  href="../a/ajoure.html">ajour&eacute;</a> might be used. Couliss&eacute; signifies that the portcullis is down.</p>

<p class="blazon">Sometimes the terms <a  href="../f/fort.html">Fort</a>, Fortress, Citadel, &amp;c., are used. The <a href="../c/castle.html">Castle</a>, too, may be surrounded with a fortification.</p>

Other additions are occasionally named, e.g. a <a  href="../t/trench.html">trench</a>, or the <a href="../c/castle.html">castle</a>, may be standing in water or surrounded by a wall.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../b/badge.html">badge</a> of Jane Seymour, third queen of Henry VIII., blazoned upon a grant of lands made to her in 1536, presents a good example of a castle. The <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> are as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The walls argent, the ground vert, the tree of the same fructed gules, the ph&oelig;nix or, in flames proper, and the roses alternately white and red.</p>
