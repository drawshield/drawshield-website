<p>Cat, (fr. chat): occurs not infrequently. Probably the wild-cat is generally intended, thought the special reference to the Cat-a-mountain in several arms seems to imply a distinction. A spotted cat is also referred to.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/cat.html">Cats</a> are found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> most frequently passant, but also <a  href="../r/rampant.html">rampant</a>, <a  href="../s/salient.html">salient</a>, <a  href="../s/statant.html">statant</a>, and <a href="../c/couchant.html">couchant</a>. With French heralds the term <a  href="../e/effarouche.html">effarouch&eacute;</a> is used to signify the <a href="../c/cat.html">cat</a> when <a  href="../r/rampant.html">rampant</a>(as if scared), and herisson&eacute;e with 'the back up.' The wild-cat is supposed always to be represented <a  href="../g/guardant.html">guardant</a>, although it be not stated in the blazoning. Musion, a fanciful name for a <a href="../c/cat.html">cat</a>, is used by BOSSEWELL.</p>
<p class="blazon">A <a href="../c/cat.html">cat's</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> is also found on one coat.</p>
