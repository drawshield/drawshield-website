<p>Chequy, Checky, Checquer-bearing, (fr. &eacute;chiquet&eacute;, old fr. eschequer&eacute;): terms applied to a <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a> or charge divided by perpendicular and horizontal lines, into small squares of metal and colour alternately. There should be at least twenty squares in the shield. If less, the number is named(as in the shield of TOLEDO, where there are 15). When only 9, with the French heralds the terms <a  href="../e/equipolle.html">equipoll&eacute;</a> is applied.</p>
<a id="104"></a><p class="blazon">This pattern is said by some to be derived from the game of chess, which if not originally introduced into Europe by the Crusaders was certainly revived by them. Others, however, with greater probably derived it from the Steward's or 'chequer' board. In the Exchequer of the kingdom, and the Chancellor of that department, the word is still retained; and the 'Checkers,' a frequent sign of small inns, with the board painted in squares on the outside, still hands down the tradition of the account board. It is not, however, impossible that this board gave the name to the game of chess played upon it.</p>
<p class="blazon">While the number of pieces in the field must be, as already said, as least twenty, a fesse or other ordinary when <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a href="../c/chequy.html">chequy</a> must contain three rows of squares, for if there be but one, the ordinary will be compony, and if but two, counter-compony. At the same time the field may have but two rows in chief of a fesse, for so the arms of Lord Clifford are represented in the glass windows at Dorchester, Hasely, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="blazon">When a <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a>, <a href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, or <a  href="../s/saltire.html">saltire</a> is checquy, the square are not placed perpendicularly, but slanting in the direction of the ordinary.</p>
