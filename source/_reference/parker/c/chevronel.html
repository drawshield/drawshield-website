<p>Chevronel: a diminutive of the <a href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a>, of which it is nominally one half the width; the term being used properly when there is more than one chevron. With the older writers, however, the term <a href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a> is used, and so may still be used when there are two or even three chevrons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, three chevronels gules.--CLARE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, three chevronels per pale, the first azure and gules, the second gules and azure, the third as the first.--WALTER DE MERTON, Bp. of Rochester, 1274-77, and founder of Merton College.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, two chevronels sable, between three roses gules, barbed and seeded proper.--William of WYKEHAM, Bp. of Winchester, 1367-1404. [Founder of the College of S.Mary at Winchester and at Oxford.]</p>
