<p>Clothiers' implements. The <a  href="../h/habick.html">habick</a> was a tool used for holding the cloth firm whilst it was operated on by the teazel or other instrument. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> is probably a corruption of the 'habiting hook,' and it is represented on the arms of the Company, as shewn in the margin.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../t/teazel.html">teazel</a> is referred to elsewhere, under <a  href="../t/thistle.html">thistle</a>. The <a  href="../s/shears.html">shears</a> for cropping the pile or nap for rendering the surface smooth will be found under the implements of Weavers.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../p/preen.html">preen</a> appears to be an instrument which was used for much the same purpose as the <a  href="../t/teazel.html">teazel</a>. It does not, however, occur in the insignia of any of the companies, but it is found in the arms of a private person, where it seems to have been chosen for the sake of the name.</p>
