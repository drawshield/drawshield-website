<h1>Cockatrice</h1>
<p>Cockatrice: amongst the monsters with <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a> the <a href="../c/cockatrice.html">Cockatrice</a> and the Wyvern(Sax. wivere, a serpent) are frequently represented in heraldry. The differ from the groups of Griffins and Dragons, inasmuch as they have only two legs, and the hinder part of the body ends in a large and long tail. The <a href="../c/cockatrice.html">Cockatrice</a> is represented as having the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> of a <a href="../c/cock.html">cock</a>, but the tongue extended and barbed. Otherwise it is very similar to the wyvern, the essential difference being that the wyvern has the head of a serpent, but with the <a  href="../t/tongue.html">tongue</a> extended and barbed. The frequency of such devices was due, no doubt, to the tales of travellers brought from the East, which had a special charm for many a designer of arms.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/cockatrice.html">Cockatrice</a>, perhaps, when correctly drawn, should have the legs and feet of a cock-the Wyvern those of an eagle, but these details are seldom observed in representation.</p>

<p class="blazon">Similar to the Cockatrice is the Basilisk, and it is usually held to be synonymous with it, but it is said in books of heraldry to have an additional head, like that of a dragon, at the end of the tail, and hence the Basilisk is sometimes termed an Amphisian Cockatrice. Similar also is the Amphistere, which is found frequently in French coats of arms, and is described as a <a  href="../w/wings.html">winged</a> <a  href="../s/serpent.html">serpent</a> with <a  href="../d/dragon.html">dragons'</a> feet, of which the <a  href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> ends in another serpent, or in more than one serpent; in the latter case it is said to be gringol&eacute; of so many serpents. The <a  href="../h/hydra.html">Hydra</a>(fr. hydre) also occurs in heraldic designs, but though compared with the <a  href="../d/dragon.html">dragon</a> it is more like the <a  href="../w/wyvern.html">wyvern</a>, having only two legs, even if it has those. The peculiarity is that it partakes somewhat of its mythological prototype, inasmuch as it has seven heads-though in one case the blazoning especially reduces the number to five.</p>
