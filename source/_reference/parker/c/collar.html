<p>Collar. A <a  href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> <a href="../c/collar.html">collar</a> is not unfrequently found surrounding the necks of Dogs, Lions, &amp;c. It is generally of <a  href="../g/gold.html">gold</a>, sometimes of <a  href="../s/silver.html">silver</a>, rarely of another tincture. The <a  href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> <a href="../c/collar.html">collar</a> does not appear to be employed separately as a <a href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>, but when an animal is said to be 'collared' or gorged(fr. accol&eacute; or collet&eacute;) a plain collar is implied; still animals are often gorged with ducal and other coronets.</p>
<p class="blazon">When a <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beast</a> is gorged and chained, the chain must be affixed to the collar and reflected over the back, as in the annexed example. Sometimes a double collar is named.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a lion rampant, gules, ducally gorged and chained or--PHILIPPS, Pembroke.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sire Johan de HAVERINGE, de argent a un lion rampaund de goules od la couwe forchie e un coler de azur--Roll, temp. ED. II.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three annulets or, on a chief argent a greyhound courant gules collared of the second--RHODES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a lion rampant ermine with a collar gemel azure; therefrom pendent on escutcheon of the last charged with a mullet argent--POWNALL, Lancaster.</p>
