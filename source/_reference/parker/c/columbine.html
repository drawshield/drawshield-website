<h1>Columbine</h1>

<p>Columbine, or Columbian flower, (aquilegia vulgaris), seems to be used more frequently than many other flowers. Possibly this may be owing to the fact that it was the badge of the House of LANCASTER. It occurs in one of the London insignia. The <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> and heraldic method of drawing is shewn in the margin, but in modern times it has been drawn as shewn below, in the arms of HALL, Bishop of Oxford. The fr. ancolie is borne by the family of BACONEL, Picardie, while the allied campanule is borne by that of HESPEL, Artois,</p>
