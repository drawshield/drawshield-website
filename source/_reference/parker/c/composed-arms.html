<h1>Composed arms</h1>
<p>Composed arms: a name given by heraldic writers in cases where a man has, or in supposed to have, added a portion of the arms of his wife or ancestors to his own, to shew his alliance or descent. The introduction of marshalling, q.v., is considered to have superseded it.</p>
