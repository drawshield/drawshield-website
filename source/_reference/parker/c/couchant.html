<h1>Couchant</h1>
<p>Couchant, (fr. couch&eacute;), i.e. lying down, is a term not often used, but it may be applied both to <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> of prey as well as to <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> of chase, that is to the lion as well as to the <a  href="../d/deer.html">deer</a>. Beasts thus described should be drawn with their heads upright, to distinguish their position from dormant. With <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> of chase the more usual term to represent this position is lodged.</p>
