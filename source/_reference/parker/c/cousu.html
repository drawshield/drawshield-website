<h1>Cousu</h1>
<p>Cousu, (fr.), meaning 'sewed to,' and the term is practically a device used by French heralds in blazoning arms, when a <a href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> and the field are both of a <a  href="../m/metal.html">metal</a> or both of a <a href="../c/colours.html">colour</a>, in order to avoid the breach of the rule which forbids metal to be placed upon metal, or colour on colour. The same would apply to a canton or any other charge where the rule is broken. But while German and Spanish arms are frequently regardless of the rule, and the French sometimes, breaches are exceedingly rule in English armory.</p>
