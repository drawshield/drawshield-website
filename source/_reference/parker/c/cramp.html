<p>Cramp, or Crampoon, and sometimes <a href="../c/crampiron.html">cramp-iron</a>(fr. Crampon), are similar to the pieces of iron bent at each extremity, used for the purpose of strengthening a building. In their origin the irons are supposed to represent the hooked attachments to the scaling-ladders. Hence a cross may be cramponny(fr. cramponn&eacute;) when the ends are thus terminated. Cramps are generally borne in pairs, and are sometimes(though erroneously) called <a  href="../f/fleam.html">Fleams</a> or Grapples.</p>
