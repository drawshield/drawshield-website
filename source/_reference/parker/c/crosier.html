<h1>Crosier</h1>
<p>Crosier, or Crozier, (lat. Crocia, a crook, fr. Croc, not from crux or cross): this word is properly restricted to the crook of an Archbishop, a Bishop, on an Abbot.</p>

<a id="147"></a><p class="blazon">The Archbishop, besides his <a href="../c/crosier.html">Crosier</a>, made use also of a <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a> <a  href="../s/surmounted-by.html">surmounted by</a> a <a href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>; that of the Pope having a triple cross. That of the see of Canterbury is represented as <a  href="../s/surmounted-by.html">surmounted by</a> a <a href="../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a  href="../f/forme.html">formy</a>. In actual examples, some few of which remain, the Archbishop's <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a> is found to be of various patterns and highly ornamented. The annexed cut represents the Staff of Archbishop Warham(who died 1520), from his tomb at Canterbury. It is borne of this form, but not so highly ornamented, in the ensigns of the archiepiscopal sees of Canterbury, Armagh, and Dublin.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/crosier.html">Crosier</a> of a <a  href="../b/bishop.html">bishop</a> ends in a curve resembling that of a shepherd's <a href="../c/crook.html">crook</a>, from which there is every reason to believe it was derived, notwithstanding the opinion of some, that its origin is to be traced to the lituus of the priesthood of pagan Rome. There are many existing specimens of episcopal staves, which, while they all retain the general form of a <a href="../c/crook.html">crook</a>, differ very much in their enrichments. In <a  href="../h/heraldry.html">heraldry</a> the simple form shewn in the margin is generally adopted.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/crosier.html">Crosier</a> and Staff surmounted by a cross are, however, often confounded under the general term <a  href="../p/pastoral-staff.html">Pastoral Staff</a>, and the French term Crosse is used equally for the crosier as for the <a  href="../s/staff.html">staff</a> with the <a href="../c/cross.html">cross</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">The pastoral staves of Abbots resembled those of bishops, and were no doubt equally ornamented, especially when the Abbot was head of the Mitred Abbeys. However, it seems there was a custom to attach a small pallium, called also sudarium, or strip, to the crosier of Abbots to distinguish them from those of Bishops, though it was not generally adhered to; and this seems to be represented on the insignia of S.Benet's, HULME. Examples are also found of Abbesses represented with a <a  href="../p/pastoral-staff.html">pastoral staff</a>, as on the brass of ISABEL HERVEY, Abbess of Elstow, Bedfordshire(ob. A.D. 1524).</p>
