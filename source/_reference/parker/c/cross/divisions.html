<h1>Divisions of the Cross</h1>
<a id="152"></a><p><b><a id="Cross5">&sect;5</a>. The Cross may be of two tinctures</b>, i.e. <a  href="../../p/party.html">party</a> per fesse, per pale, &amp;c., or per cross, which is equivalent to quarterly(fr. &eacute;cartelee), and in most cases it is so in connection with the <a  href="../../p/partition.html">partition</a> of the <a  href="../../f/field.html">field</a>, and hence the tinctures are counter-changed. Though some heralds would use the term counter-quartered, the term counter-changed applied to the <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> is all that is needed. The <a  href="../../p/partition.html">partition</a> lines should meet in the centre in a cross and not in a saltire.</p>

<p>When, however, the cross is composed as it were, of five pieces or divisions, the central being that of the field, the term <a  href="../../q/quarter-pierced.html">quarter-pierced</a> is used. Heraldic writers have, however, invented various terms, e.g. quarter-voided and square-pierced. And some have described the form(taking the field into account) as 'chequy of nine panes;' but it is to be noted that as a rule the pieces are charged with some device. With the French, however, the term <a  href="../../e/equipolle.html">&eacute;quipoll&eacute;e</a> describes the figure exactly.</p>
