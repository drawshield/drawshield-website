<a id="164"></a><p><b><a id="Cross20">&sect;20</a>. Of crosses with a floriated termination </b>there are many varieties found in the actual emblazoning, but the nomenclature both of French and English heralds appears to be in a very unsatisfactory condition. The term most frequently employed is a cross fleury, and this is written also <a  href="../../f/flory.html">flory</a>, floretty, and fleuronny, while the modern French heralds give us fleur&eacute;e, fleuronn&eacute;e, florenc&eacute; (or fleuronc&eacute;e), and fleur-de-lis&eacute;e. It is not easy, however, to distinguish these from each other, or correlate them with the English terms, or with those used in ancient heraldry.</p>
<p>The commonly-accepted distinction by English heralds is that fleury signifies the cross itself terminating in the form of the upper portion of a fleur-de-lis, but that fleuretty(which is seldom used) signifies the cross to be couped, and the flower, as it were, protruding from the portion so couped; but it is a great question whether there is the slightest authority for such to be obtained from actual examples, or any such agreement to be found amongst the heralds of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As to the French terms, fleur&eacute;e seems not to be applied so much to the cross as to other ordinaries, and signifies rather the edges ornamented with <a  href="../../f/flowers.html">flowers</a> or trefoils, while fleuri is applied only to plants in flower. The French fleur-de-lis&eacute;e, on the other hand, seems to be the equivalent of the English fleuretty, and is represented with the <a  href="../../f/flowers.html">flower</a> protruding from the couped ends of the cross. The florenc&eacute;e and fleuronn&eacute;e seem to be practically the same term, and both to be the equivalent of the English fleury. On the other hand, fleur-de-lis&eacute;e seems in English blazon to be applied to the edges of the cross rather than to the ends, and consequently to be synonymous with the French fleur&eacute;e.</p>
<a id="165"></a><p>We find also confusion in drawings between the cross fleury and the cross patonce, which latter, it will be seen, may be said to <a  href="../../l/lie.html">lie</a> between a cross fleury and a cross pat&eacute;e, according to some authorities, though drawn differently by others.</p>
<p>It will be observed that in the old blazon, the ends(chefs or bouts) are sometimes described as fleuretty. "Richard SUWARD, who accompanied those[at Caerlaverock], had a black banner painted with a <a  href="../../w/white.html">white</a> <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> with the ends fleuretty."</p>
