<h1>Cross Portate</h1>
<a id="175"></a><p><b><a id="Cross30">&sect;30</a>. <a id="Cross-portate">Cross portate or portante</a></b>: an ambiguous term which Edmondson says is given by Randle Holmes to a long cross raguly. Other heraldic writers give it to a peculiar form, which is neither chevron, bend, nor cross, but an odd admixture of the three, and is so drawn by Berry, who says that double portant means a <a href="../../c/cross/patriarchal.html">cross patriarcale</a>. The idea seems to be a cross 'in bend,' as if being carried. Confusion has also, no doubt, arisen from had drawing, hasty writing, and careless reading. One coat of arms only has a cross so blazoned.</p>
