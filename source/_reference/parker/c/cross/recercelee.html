<h1>Cross Recercel&eacute;e</h1>

<p><b><a id="Cross32">&sect;32</a>. <a id="Cross-recercelee">Cross recercel&eacute;e</a></b>: of all the crosses perhaps this has been the most disputed by heraldic writers. We find the term sarcelly more frequently used, but there are so many varieties of spelling adopted by different authors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, that it is a question whether there is one word or two; attempts, however, appear to have been made to distinguish different meanings attached to different modes of spelling. They are as follows, so far as printed works go(manuscript readings would add to the number):--cercel&eacute;e, recercell&eacute;, recersile, resarcel&eacute;e, resarcelled, sarcel&eacute;e, sarcelly. One writer speaks of cercl&eacute;e being spelt cercel&eacute;e and recercel&eacute;e, and so confused with the sarcelly.</p>
<a id="177"></a><p>The term as applied to the <a href="../../c/cross.html">Cross</a> occurs twice in one of the two rolls which are apparently of HENRY III.rd's reign. Also in a roll temp. EDWARD II. two examples occur with the term <a  href="../../v/voided.html">voided</a> added and one without, though in the latter voided is, no doubt, implied; hence, as the general outline was similar to the cross moline, it may be considered as a <a href="../../c/cross/moline.html">cross moline</a> <a  href="../../v/voided.html">voided</a>, or disjoined, and drawn as in arms of KNOWLES opposite. See  &sect;6.</p>
<p>The appearance is just as if in order to strengthen his <a  href="../../s/shield.html">shield</a> the smith had taken four pieces of iron and bent them round, as was done in the case of hinges and other ornamental iron-work found remaining on church doors, &amp;c., of the 13th and 14th centuries, primarily to add strength to the woodwork, but at the same time ornamentation.</p>
<p>Modern heralds seem to use the term alike for the <a href="../../c/cross/moline.html">cross moline</a> and for the cross moline <a  href="../../v/voided.html">voided</a>, and employ usually in blazon the spelling sarcelly. But beyond this, in various books on heraldry, both English and foreign, an attempt is made to distinguish between recercel&eacute;, i.e. <a href="../../c/cercle.html">cercl&eacute;</a> or circled, and sarcelly, defined by Berry as 'a cross voided, or as it were, sawed apart.' See more under <a  href="../../r/recercele.html">Recercel&eacute;</a>.</p>
