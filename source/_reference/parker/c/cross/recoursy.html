<h1>Cross Recoursy</h1>
<p><b><a id="Cross33">&sect;33</a>. <a id="Cross-recoursy">Cross recoursy</a></b>(fr. raccourcie): a very doubtful term, Modern French heraldic works distinctly consider it to be the same as <a href="../../c/couped.html">couped</a>, but Berry, who appears to have based his definition on Edmondson and other English heraldic works, implies that it means <a  href="../../v/voided.html">voided</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a cross crosslet recoursy argent--BASING.</p>
