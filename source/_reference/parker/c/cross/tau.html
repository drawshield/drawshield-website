<p><b><a id="Cross34">&sect;34</a>. <a id="Cross-tau">Cross tau</a></b>, or of S.Anthony, who is represented with such a cross embroidered upon the left side of his garment. It is called <a href="../../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a href="../../c/commisse.html">commisse</a> by some heraldic writers, with a somewhat fanciful allusion to Ezekiel, chap. ix. ver. 4, or as representing the token of absolution with which malefactors are said to have been stamped on the hand. It should be drawn like a Greek Tau.</p>
