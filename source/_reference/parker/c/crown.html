<h1>Crown</h1>
<p>Crown, (fr. couronne): this word occurring in blazon without any addition usually implies a ducal coronet without the <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a>. When <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> it signifies that it is of gold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a crown sable garnished gold--BELLINGHAM.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three crowns or--LEE, co. York.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a> royal of England, sometimes also called an Imperial crown. The forms of the <a href="../c/crown.html">crowns</a> worn by the successive kings of England very considerably, and will be found in architectural illustrations of the sculptured heads of kings from monuments and other stone carvings in churches[see examples in Rickman's Gothic Architecture, sixth and seventh Editions]; but in this place they must be considered only in their connection with armorial bearings. The earliest instance of the royal arms being ensigned with a <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> is in the case of those of Henry VI. At this time the crown had attained its present form, with the exception of the number of arches. The <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Edward IV. are surmounted by the rim of the crown only, adorned with <a href="../c/cross.html">crosses</a> <a  href="../p/pattee.html">patt&eacute;e</a> and fleur-de-lis. The <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> of Richard III. shews five semi-arches, that of Henry VII. shews but four, and his successor's only three, although seldom met with until about the time of James II., before which five semi-arches were generally shewn. Several instances of Royal crowns are found on coats of arms.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> of Spain, as used by <a  href="../k/king.html">King</a> Philip II., consort of Queen Mary of England, was a circle of gold jewelled, supporting eight strawberry-leaves. Four ogee arches, pearled, were sometimes added, meeting under a <a  href="../m/mound.html">mound</a> and cross patt&eacute;e. No cap.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/crown.html">crown</a> of <a  href="../s/scotland.html">Scotland</a>, as borne by James VI. before his succession to the throne of England, exactly resembled the imperial crown of Great Britain. It is represented in the Crest of Scotland(q.v.). This differs essentially from the actual crown of Scotland, discovered in Edinburgh Castle in 1817.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a> of Rue, (fr. Crancelin, from germ. Kranslein): the ancient arms of the Dukedom of Saxony were barry of eight, or and sable. The story goes that the bend vert was added by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, when he confirmed the dukedom on Bernard of Anhalt(c. 1156), who desiring some mark to distinguish him from the dukes of the former house, the emperor took a chaplet of rue which he had upon his <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a>, and threw it across the shield. These were the paternal arms of the late Prince ALBERT. The bearing is sometimes called a ducal coronet in bend, and sometimes a <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a> archy coronetty.</p>
<p class="blazon">Papal or Triple crown: see <a  href="../t/tiara.html">Tiara</a>. Crown of Thorns: see <a  href="../t/thorns.html">Thorns</a>, <a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a> of. The <a href="../c/crown.html">Crown</a> Obsidional, and Crown Triumphal(composed of grass and of laurel or bay-leaves) have been already noticed under <a href="../c/chaplet.html">Chaplet</a>.</p>
<a id="186"></a><p class="blazon">Under the article Crown it is convenient to include Coronet, as the two terms are in some cases interchangeable.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/186a.png" alt="Helmet of EDWARD the Black Prince." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Helmet of EDWARD the Black Prince.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">From the reign of Edward III. coronets of various forms were worn(as it seems indiscriminately) by princes, dukes, earls, and even knights, but apparently rather by way of ornament than distinction, or if for distinction, only(like the <a href="../c/collar.html">collar</a> of SS) as a mark of gentility. The <a  href="../h/helmet.html">helmet</a> of Edward the Black Prince, upon his effigy at Canterbury, is surrounded with a <a href="../c/coronet.html">coronet</a> totally different from that subsequently assigned to his rank.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../c/coronet.html">coronets</a> at present in use in England are the following, but connected more frequently with the <a href="../c/crest.html">Crest</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">1. The <a href="../c/coronet.html">coronet</a> of the PRINCE OF WALES only differs from the royal crown in the omission of one of the arches. Edward, the son of Richard III., is recorded to have worn a demy crown on the day of his father's coronation at York(June 26, 1483); and was that day created Prince of Wales. It was formerly only the rim of the crown; but the arch was added in pursuance of a warrant of King Charles II., February 9, 1661.</p>
<p class="blazon">2. That of the PRINCESS ROYAL has a coronet composed of four fleur-de-lis, two crosses, and two strawberry leaves; one of the crosses appearing in the centre. Within the circle is a cap of crimson velvet turned up with <a  href="../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>, and <a href="../c/close.html">closed</a> at the top with a golden tassel.</p>
<p class="blazon">3. That of other PRINCES and PRINCESSES, sons and daughters of a sovereign, resembles the coronet of the Prince of Wales, but without the <a  href="../a/arch.html">arch</a>. The <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> as before.</p>
<p class="blazon">4. That of PRINCES and PRINCESSES, sons and daughters of the above, is similar, except that strawberry-leaves are substituted for the fleur-de-lis. The Princes' <a href="../c/crown.html">crowns</a>, however, are usually drawn in heraldry after a somewhat conventional manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a prince's coronet .... between two ostrich feathers in chief, a garb in base, all within a bordure sable bezant&eacute;--Town of EVESHAM.</p>
<a id="187"></a><p class="blazon">Ermine, on a chief gules three prince's crowns composed of crosses patt&eacute;e and fleur-de-lys or, with caps of the first, tasselled of the third--SKINNERS' Company[incorporated 1327, confirmed 1395].</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/187a.png" alt="Duke." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Duke.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">5. That of DUKES is a circle of gold richly chased, and having upon its upper edge eight strawberry-leaves; only five are shewn in the drawing, two of them being in profile. The <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> is of crimson velvet lined with <a  href="../w/white.html">white</a> taffeta and turned up with <a  href="../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>. At the top is a gold tassel. A <a href="../c/coronet.html">coronet</a> without the <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a>, and shewing but three leaves, is called a Ducal coronet, and frequently a Ducal crown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three ducal crowns two and one or, each pierced with two arrows in saltire of the last--Abbey of BURY S.EDMUNDS.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, two lions passant guardant in pale or; in chief two ducal coronets of the last--Priory of S.BARTHOLOMEW THE GREAT, London.</p>

<p class="blazon">6. That of the MARQUIS is a rim of gold richly chased, supporting four strawberry-leaves and as many large pearls(or rather <a  href="../b/ball.html">balls</a> of <a  href="../s/silver.html">silver</a>) upon short points. The <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> as before, though in heraldic drawings it is usually omitted.</p>

<p class="blazon">7. That of the EARL. A rim of gold richly chased, on the upper edge of which are eight strawberry-leaves, and the same number of pearls set upon high points, so that it is readily distinguished from the coronet of the marquis. The <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a>, if shewn, the same as the first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a roundle argent between three earl's coronets or--CORONA.</p>

<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/187d.png" alt="Viscount." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Viscount.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">8. A <a  href="../v/viscount.html">VISCOUNT'S</a> <a href="../c/coronet.html">Coronet</a> is a chased circle of gold supporting twelve, fourteen, or, as some say, sixteen pearls, but usually only seven visible. The <a href="../c/cap.html">cap</a> resembles those of the other coronets. This coronet was appointed by King James I.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/188a.png" alt="Baron." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Baron.</figcaption></figure>

Before that period they wore caps of crimson velvet turned up with <a  href="../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>, and at a still earlier period, scarlet caps turned up with <a  href="../w/white.html">white</a> <a  href="../f/furs.html">fur</a>.</p>
