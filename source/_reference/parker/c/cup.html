<p>Cup, (old fr. Coupe): the cup was rather a favourite device from the fourteenth century onwards, as shewn by several references to it in the Rolls of Edward II. and Edward III. The <a  href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> chalice-like <a href="../c/cup.html">cup</a> without a cover was perhaps first emblazoned, such as is found <a  href="../f/figured.html">figured</a> on incised slabs, &amp;c.; but it is sometimes represented in modern heraldry ornamented, as shewn in the drawing of the arms of CANDISH.</p>

<p class="blazon">But many families, especially those of BUTLER and CLEAVER, bear covered cups(fr. coupes couvertes), which are frequently represented on their tombs, and which are similar in shape to that in the margin, which is taken from the tomb of Johan le BOTILER, c. 1290, in the church of S.Bride, Glamorganshire.</p>
