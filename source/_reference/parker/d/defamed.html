<h1>Defamed</h1>
<p>Defamed, (fr. diffam&eacute;): a term applied to <a  href="../l/lion.html">lion</a> or other beast(and perhaps also to an <a  href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a>) which has lost its tail. Defamed looking backwards is given by some writers for counter rampant regardant, the lion being supposed to be flying from an enemy, but it is doubtful if any example exists.</p>
