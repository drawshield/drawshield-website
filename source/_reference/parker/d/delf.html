<p>Delf, or Delph, (plural delves). This ward(derived from the verb delve, to dig) is the name of a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> representing a shovelful of earth: the sides are sometimes drawn straight, sometimes curved inwards. When <a  href="../t/tenne.html">tenne</a>, it is said to be one of the abatements, and it is then over the fesse point. See also <a  href="../g/gad.html">Gad</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three delves gules--DELVES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a fesse wavy between three delves[elsewhere billets] sable--STANFORD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The representations of this charge are sometimes very doubtful, and they have been blazoned <a  href="../c/cubes.html">cubes</a>, <a  href="../g/gad.html">gads</a>(as in the insignia of the IRONMONGERS' COMPANY), blocks, &amp;c.: but in the following examples the cubes are no doubt intended for dice, and should be drawn as such.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a chevron between three dice sable, each charged with four spots--ENGLOWES, Somerset.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three dice sable, each charged with a cinquefoil[? 5 spots] of the first--FITZWILLIAMS, York.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three dice argent, on each five(six ?) spots in front, two upon the top, and three on the sinister side, sable--MATTHIAS, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The last of those given is supposed to be allusive to the election of S.Matthias to the Apostleship.</p>
