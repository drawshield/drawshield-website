<h1>Diamond</h1>
<p>Diamond, (fr. diamant): this, the chief of precious stones, is sometimes represented in English, but more frequently in French, coats of arms, and with this may be associated both the <a  href="../c/crystals.html">crystal</a> and the brilliant. The term, however, it may be added, has been chosen in the fanciful blazoning of the arms of peers in the seventeenth century for sable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a mount vert, a palm tree of the last thereon pendent a shield azure, charged with three mullets of the first pierced of the third; on a chief of the last a sun proper between two rings or, each adorned with a diamond--NORDEN, London, [1771].</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a chevron between nine links of a chain, each division consisting of three links sable. On a chief gules, a large diamond set in the midst of a triangle within a double row of brilliants proper--MIGNOT.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a fesse gules, three Crystals .... in a bordure ermine--BOUSALL, Co. Cardigan.</p>
<p class="blazon">De gueules, &agrave; trois diamants en lozanges taille&eacute;s a facettes d'argent, en fasces--AFFAGARD, Normandie.</p>
