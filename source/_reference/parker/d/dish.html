<p>Dish, or standish; this is represented as in the margin, in Bp. STANDISH'S arms, and the charge is also found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as a <a  href="../p/platter.html">platter</a>. Though in the second example the charge is blazoned as a <a href="../d/dish.html">dish</a>, it was probably intended for a bowl.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three dishes argent--STANDISH, Bp. of S.Asaph, 1518-35.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three boar's heads couped argent, within as many dishes or--BOLLES, Lincoln.</p>
