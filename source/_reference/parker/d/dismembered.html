<h1>Dismembered</h1>
<p>Dismembered, (fr. demembr&eacute;, or dechauss&eacute;), is said by writers to be applied to <a  href="../b/beasts.html">beasts</a> whose heads, feet, or tails are cut off, but left so near the parts whence they were severed that the outline of the animal remains the same, but the term has not been met with in actual use. The French term <a  href="../t/tronconne.html">tronconn&eacute;</a>, or <a  href="../t/tronconne.html">trononn&eacute;</a>, is said to be applied to various charges, and even to ordinaries when so severed. See <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;7.</p>
