<h1>Dog</h1>
<p>Dog, (fr. chien): occurs very frequently in armorial bearings, and under a variety of names; the drawing in most cases being made generally to suit the dog described. The oldest name is the levrier, spelt leverer, and amongst the arms of the last two or three centuries the greyhound is the most frequently chosen, the bloodhound and the ratch-hound but rarely.</p>
<a id="205"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../t/talbot.html">talbot</a> is a hunting-dog, distinguished chiefly by the form of his <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a>; the modern mastiff occurs is one or two coats of arms, and we find also the <a  href="../s/spaniel.html">spaniel</a> and the terrier. The <a  href="../a/alant.html">Alant</a>, or Aland, [Span. alano., med. lat. Canes alani], a mastiff with short ears, appears to be used only as the <a  href="../s/supporters.html">supporter</a> of the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Lord DACRE.</p>

<p class="blazon">In the following examples it will be seen that besides the <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> position of the dog, which is passant, it may be represented, sejant, rampant, salient, skipping, questing(i.e. <a  href="../p/point.html">pointing</a>), courant, and in full cry. The <a  href="../e/ear.html">ears</a> may be of a different tincture, and it is frequently gorged or collared.</p>
