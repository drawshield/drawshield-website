<h1>Dolphin</h1>
<p>Dolphin, (fr. dauphin): the Dolphin, which is not a true fish at all, according to the system of naturalists, was considered by the older heralds as the <a  href="../c/chief.html">chief</a> of <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>, just as the <a  href="../l/lion.html">lion</a> was the chief of beasts, and the eagle the chief of birds.</p>
<p class="blazon">It is even used in arms when it is supposed to be a play upon the name of <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a fesse wavy or between two crescents in chief, and a dolphin in base argent--FISH, Kempton, Middlesex.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a dolphin or; a chief ermine--FISHER, Whitlingham, Norfolk.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a dolphin embowed between three ears of wheat or--John FYSHAR, Bp. of Rochester. [From a facsimile of a Parliament Roll, 1515.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">In the <a  href="../a/arms.html">Arms</a> of the FISHMONGERS' Company of London, both the <a href="../d/dolphin.html">Dolphin</a>, and the <a  href="../l/lucy.html">Lucy</a>, or <a  href="../p/pike.html">pike</a>, are borne-intended, no doubt, the one as the type of the sea-fish, the other of those of fresh-water. It is probably due to the same reason that several Lord Mayors, who were members of the Fishmongers' Company, bore the dolphin in their arms; and perhaps also why some seaport towns also <a  href="../b/bear.html">bear</a> it, e.g. BRIGHTON.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three dolphins naiant in pale argent, finned and ducally crowned or, between two pair of lucies in saltire, the sinister surmounting the dexter proper; over the nose of each lucy a ducal crown of the third; on a chief gules three pair of keys endorsed in saltire or--FISHMONGERS' COMPANY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a fesse or between three dolphins embowed argent--Sir William ASKHAM, Lord Mayor of London, 1404.</p>
<p class="blazon">A chevron between three dolphins embowed--Sir John RAINWELL, Lord Mayor of London, and Fishmonger, 1426.</p>

<a id="208"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../b/badge.html">badge</a> of the County of Dauphin&eacute; in France appears from the thirteenth century onwards to have been a Dolphin, an early example of 'Armes parlantes.' It was subsequently borne by the Dauphins, who were sty ed Lords of Auvergne. In the fourteenth century the title of Dauphin being adopted as the style of the eldest son of the King of France, the charge frequently appears. The <a  href="../a/arms.html">Arms</a> of the Dauphin, son of Louis XIV., represent in the third and fourth quarters a dolphin, while the crown which serves as the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> is ornamented also with <a href="../d/dolphin.html">dolphins</a>. The <a href="../d/dolphin.html">Dolphin</a> is also used in other canting arms, besides those of the DAUPHIN of France, i.e. the Venetian family of DOLFIN, and the English families of DOLPHIN, DOLPHINLEY, DOLPHINTON, and Lord GODOLPHIN.</p>
<p class="blazon">Although the fish is in reality straight it is always represented <a  href="../e/embowed.html">embowed</a>, i.e. curved, and this term is often added in the blazon; in more recent drawing it is represented with a double curve, i.e. <a  href="../b/bowed.html">bowed</a> <a  href="../e/embowed.html">embowed</a>, though the terms are not used. It is blazoned either hauriant(i.e. <a  href="../u/upright.html">upright</a>), or naiant, i.e. in fesse; sometimes also <a  href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>. It may be also <a  href="../v/vorant.html">vorant</a>(i.e. <a  href="../s/swallow.html">swallowing</a> a <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>). It may be <a  href="../f/fimbriated.html">fimbriated</a> or finned of a different tincture.</p>
