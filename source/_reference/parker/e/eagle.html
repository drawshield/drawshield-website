<h1>Eagle</h1>
<p>Eagle, (fr. Aigle): the eagle being the recognized king of birds, it is natural that it should from a favourite device. With the Romans, it will be remembered, it was adopted as their ensign, no doubt as symbolical of the courage and power attributed to that bird. It is found very frequently in the earlier rolls of arms, and is very common <a  href="../t/throughout.html">throughout</a> the Middle Ages. In the <a  href="../r/roll.html">roll</a>, for instance, of the time of Edward II., to which reference has already been made, over forty coats of arms bear eagles. In that, however, of Henry III. there are only two or three, and in that of Edward III. not so large a number in proportion. From the following selection it will be observed that amongst the earliest examples the beak and claws are blazoned of a different tincture from that of the body; and in Edward the Second's reign we find the double-headed eagle, and in Edward the Third's reign we get the term <a href="../e/espanie.html">espanie</a>, signifying <a  href="../d/displayed.html">displayed</a>, or <a  href="../s/spread.html">spread</a> out; (conf. modern fr. &eacute;pandre). The mention, too, of the eagles being tinctured barry implies rather that they were represented <a  href="../d/displayed.html">displayed</a>, even where not so described.</p>

<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/214b.png" alt="Eagle Displayed. Wings inverted." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Eagle Displayed. Wings inverted.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">In later arms also, an <a href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a> is more frequently rendered displayed(mod. fr. eploy&eacute;). and it may be drawn in two different ways. The first figure shews an eagle with its wings elevated, which is what is generally intended by the phrase 'an eagle displayed,' and the second with its wings inverted. The <a  href="../d/differences.html">difference</a> appears, however, to be an accidental one. The term <a href="../e/expanded.html">expanded</a> is also found sometimes used, which implies, perhaps, that the wings are displayed more than usual. Unless otherwise appointed, the eagle is to be drawn with the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> looking towards the dexter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed vert, armed sable--MONTHERMER.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed gules, armed azure--PEVENSEY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed wings downwards sable--FREDERICK II., Emperor of Germany, and EDMUND, E. of Cornwall, son of Richard, the king of the Romans.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an eagle displayed wings downwards argent, crowned or--(Part of the arms of) DIEPHOLZ.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an eagle displayed reguardant sable armed or--BOKELAND.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an eagle wings expanded sable, armed or--HILTOFTE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an eagle reguardant, wings expanded or armed gules--CANVILL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">But there are various terms which, though not confined to the eagle, are more frequently applied to it than to other birds, namely, as regards its wings, and the several positions in which it is represented.</p>
<a id="215"></a><p class="blazon">It may be with <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a> <a  href="../c/close.html">close</a>, i.e. <a  href="../c/close.html">closed</a>, or it may be with its wings elevated, or it may be with <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a> <a  href="../d/disclosed.html">disclosed</a>, i.e. somewhat open, but inverted, and pointing downwards(and this is practically the same as the expression overt, written sometimes overture).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, an eagle close or--ROPER, Derby.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a chevron ermine between three eagles close argent--GAMES, Leicester, granted 1614.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable a chevron between three eagles close argent--JERVOISE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an eagle with wings elevated argent--COTON, Ashill, Norfolk.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a bendlet(or baston) sable, between in chief an eagle rising overt vert, and in base a cross crosslet of the second--RICSWORTH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">If it is recursant, it means the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> is turned back towards the sinister, the term <a  href="../r/regardant.html">reguardant</a> being used for the same. If in full aspect, it is facing the spectator; if in trian aspect, something between that and facing towards the dexter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, a bendlet(or baston) gules between three eagles close in trian aspect sable--Robert WILTRAM, co. York.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an eagle reguardant to the sinister, rising wings overt and inverted or, breaked gules--Richard CANVILL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Again, an eagle may be <a  href="../r/rising.html">rising</a>, that is, about to fly; <a  href="../v/volant.html">volant</a>, that is, flying; or eyrant, that is, sitting, as it were, on its nest; or it may be <a  href="../s/statant.html">statant</a>, i.e. standing in an ordinary position; and if so, generally <a  href="../p/perched.html">perched</a> upon some branch or other object, or holding something in its mouth; or it may be represented as preyant; or, again, pruning its wings. These are a few for which examples are readily found; but to judge of the varieties which might be adopted, the reader is referred to those noted under <a  href="../b/birds.html">Bird</a>, and to the article Wings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an eagle recursant wings overture sable--BACK.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an eagle rising, wings overt inverted gules, standing on a baston raguly in bend vert--William PORTER.</p>

<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed pruning its wings azure, armed gules--ROUS, co. Devon, and HALTON, co. Cornwall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Again, Eagles, whether in any of the positions above named, or displayed, may have their beaks, talons, or legs of a different tincture from that of the body. Of the <a  href="../t/talons.html">talons</a> the term <a  href="../a/armed.html">armed</a> in most frequently used, though unguled(fr. ongl&eacute;) is sometimes used; of the <a  href="../l/leg.html">legs</a>, <a  href="../m/membered.html">membered</a>(fr. membr&eacute;); of the beak, beaked(fr. becqu&eacute;.) It is not unusual, too, to find an <a href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a> <a  href="../c/crown.html">crowned</a>, or having a <a  href="../c/collar.html">collar</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an eagle displayed sable, armed purple--EAGLESTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, three bars azure, over all an eagle displayed gules, beaked and armed or--JERNEGAN, Fitz-Hugh.</p>

<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed azure, holding in the dexter talon a rose slipped in pale proper--CARNEGIE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">When three or more eagles occur in the same <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> they are generally represented <a  href="../d/displayed.html">displayed</a>, though occasionally they are found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> otherwise. If they are more than three they are generally <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a href="../e/eaglets.html">eaglets</a>.</p>

<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/217a.png" alt="German Empire." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">German Empire.</figcaption></figure>

<a id="217"></a><p class="blazon">The double-headed eagle was borne by the German emperors(who claimed to be considered the successors of the C&aelig;sars of Rome), and hence the term frequently applied to it is imperial eagle. The <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a> of the imperial eagle are always drawn by German heralds with a small feather between each pair of large ones. An <a href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a> is also borne by the emperor or czar(that is C&aelig;sar) of Russia. In the Bulle d'or of Charles IV. (A.D. 1323) the eagle is there represented with but one head, and it is not until Sigismund has son began his reign that we find the <a href="../e/eagle.html">eagle</a> represented double headed.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../e/eagle.html">eagles</a> in the arms of many English families can be traced to some former connection between those families and the German empire. The <a href="../e/eagle.html">Eagle</a> of <a  href="../f/france.html">France</a> dates from Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p class="blazon">Or, an eagle displayed with two necks sable--MILLINGTON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">One monstrosity may be mentioned, viz. <a href="../e/eagle.html">Eagles'</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> with <a  href="../h/hound.html">hounds'</a> <a href="../e/ear.html">ears</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a href="../e/eagle.html">Eagles</a> occur sometimes as <a  href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a>; e.g. two Eagles are the supporters to the Arms of CLARKE of Courie Castle, co. Perth.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../e/eagle.html">Eagles'</a> <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a> are also borne by themselves; also the <a  href="../l/leg.html">legs</a>, which are frequently blazoned as <a href="../e/erased.html">erased</a> a-la-quise, q.v.</p>
