<h1>Ear</h1>
<p>Ear: the ear is seldom borne separately, but it is not uncommon in some animals, e.g. <a  href="../d/dog.html">dogs</a>, to find the <a href="../e/ear.html">ears</a> <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> of another tincture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three hind's ears gules--AUDICE.</p>
</blockquote>
