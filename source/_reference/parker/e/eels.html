<h1>Eels</h1>
<p>Eels. These are not very common on English Arms, and generally adopted, as will be observed by the examples, on account of the name. Neither the anguille or the congre have been observed on French arms. Eels may be represented <a  href="../n/naiant.html">naiant</a> and hauriant, terms usually applied to <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a>; also <a  href="../n/nowed.html">nowed</a>, a term which is applied to <a  href="../s/snake.html">snakes</a>, and <a href="../e/embowed.html">embowed</a>, which is applied to <a  href="../d/dolphin.html">dolphins</a>. The small eels are termed grigs.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../c/congers.html">Conger</a> <a href="../e/eels.html">eel</a>, a large eel found upon the British coasts, is as frequently adopted as the <a href="../e/eels.html">eels</a> of the <a  href="../r/river.html">rivers</a>. The <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> is perhaps more frequently found in heraldry than the whole fish, and also demi-congers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">At the same time, it should be noted that there seems to be often a confusion between lucies' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> and eels' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>, from the similarity of drawing.</p>
