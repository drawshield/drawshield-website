<h1>Effets</h1>
<p>Effets: these in heraldic drawing are perhaps hardly to be distinguished from lizards, and hence the same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> are sometimes variously blazoned. The <a  href="../a/asker.html">asker</a>, which is a water-lizard, and the newt, are also found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three effets in pale proper--COTTER, Ireland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three asker's heads couped or--ALSACHER, Chester.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an asker's head erased or--ALSARIN.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a newt vert, in chief a lion rampant gules, all within a bordure of the last--SUTTON.</p>
</blockquote>
