<h1>Elder-leaves</h1>
<p>Elder-leaves appear in one coat of arms on account of the name, but neither the elder-tree nor the elder-berry seem to occur unless the alder berry, q.v., is intended for the latter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse wreathed of five pieces gules and vert; in chief two elder-leaves of the third, and a crescent in base azure--ELDERSHAW, Scotland.</p>
</blockquote>
