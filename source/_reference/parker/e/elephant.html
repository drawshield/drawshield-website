<h1>Elephant</h1>
<p>Elephant. (fr. &eacute;l&eacute;phant): occurs in a few insignia of cities, and in the arms of some families. The <a  href="../t/trunk.html">trunks</a> or probosces(fr. proboscides) occur separate in some few cases. The tusk in French blazon is called the <a  href="../d/defense.html">defense</a>, and tusked is described as defendu of such a tincture.
