<p>Emanche, (fr.): a term about which English heralds seem to differ. It is, however, confined to French and German heraldry, and appears to be a piece partitioned off from the shield by a dancetty line, but often so much exaggerated as to be like two or three piles; they may be <a  href="../u/upright.html">upright</a> or fesswise; the indentations appear not to be always drawn uniform.</p>
<p class="blazon">The adjectival form emanch&eacute; is perhaps more common than the substantive, an emanche. When there is only one projection the term <a href="../e/embrasse.html">embrass&eacute;</a> seems to be employed by French heralds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Emanch&eacute; d'or et d'azure de trois piec&egrave;s, &agrave; trois besants d'or en pointe; au chef d'argent charg&eacute; de trois bouterolles de gueules--BRUYSEL DE SURE.</p>
<p class="blazon">D'argent embrass&eacute; de gueules de s&eacute;nestre a droite--DOMANTZ, Silesia.</p>
