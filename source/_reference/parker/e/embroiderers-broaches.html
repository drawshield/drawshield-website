<p>Embroiderers' Broaches, Trundles, and Quill.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../b/broaches.html">broach</a> is an instrument used by embroiderers, and borne by their several companies; it is represented as in the margin, but as a rule two are borne together in saltire.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../t/trundles.html">Trundle</a> represents a quill of gold thread, two of which are represented in the arms of the London company, as in fig. 1, though in the drawing there appears to be some confusion between the trundles, fusils, and quills when full.</p>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/226a.png" alt="Quills." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Quills.</figcaption></figure>

<a id="226"></a><p class="blazon"><a  href="../q/quill.html">Quill</a>(or <a  href="../w/wheel.html">wheel</a> <a  href="../q/quill.html">quill</a>) of yarn, if full, would be represented as in fig. 2; an empty quill as in fig. 3; but there are many varieties of drawing of the same <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a>. See also <a  href="../f/fusil.html">Fusil</a>.</p>
