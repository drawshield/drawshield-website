<h1>Faces</h1>
<p>Faces: in French arms the human face is sometimes represented on charges, such as <a  href="../r/roundles.html">roundles</a>, &amp;c., and in English arms the sun is generally represented as having such a face. Leopards' and bucks' <a href="../f/faces.html">faces</a> also occur, signifying that the head is caboshed, i.e. shewing only the front portion, and badly expressed. Bacchus' <a href="../f/faces.html">faces</a> is a term also found, but in this case it would have been more correct if they had been blazoned <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>.</p>
