<h1>Fetterlock</h1>

<p>Fetterlock: this, so far as heraldic drawing is concerned, appears to be the same as what is elsewhere blazoned as <a  href="../s/shacklebolt.html">shacklebolt</a>, shackbolt, or manacle. It is, in fact, a 'handcuff,' or prisoners' <a  href="../b/bolt.html">bolt</a>, and generally represented as shewn in the margin, though sometimes represented of a <a  href="../s/square.html">square</a> form. In the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of SHAKERLY, Worcestershire, they are sometimes represented more like oval rings, while in the crest of WYNDHAM the semicircular part is generally represented as a <a  href="../c/chain.html">chain</a>, and in the badge of PERCY it is made to resemble the swivel, as in the arms of the IRONMONGERS. A double bolt also occurs in the arms of ANDERTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> does not seem to occur in the more ancient rolls, but it is found very widely spread among several ancient families.</p>

<p class="blazon">A <a href="../f/falcon.html">falcon</a> <a  href="../d/displayed.html">displayed</a> within a closed fetterlock was a badge of King Edward IV. for the dukedom of York.
