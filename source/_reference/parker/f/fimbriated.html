<h1>Fimbriated</h1>
<p>Fimbriated, (fr. bord&eacute;): said by strict heralds to be applied only to an ordinary or other charge having a narrow edging of some other tincture all round it, so that if ant part touches the outer edging of the shield without the border being continued in that part the term should not be applied, but the term <a  href="../e/edged.html">edged</a> instead. This distinction, however, is never adhered to in practice. The <a  href="../c/cross.html">crosses</a>, for instance, in what is termed the <a  href="../u/union-jack.html">Union Jack</a>(see <a href="../f/flag.html">flag</a>) are always blazoned as <a href="../f/fimbriated.html">fimbriated</a>, and many other examples might be cited. When applied to the <a  href="../d/dolphin.html">dolphin</a> is probably only extends along the dorsal ridge.</p>
