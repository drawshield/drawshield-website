<p>Fire: flames of fire(fr. flammes) are not at all a rare device in coats of arms, though not observed to occur in arms before the sixteenth century; sometimes by themselves, but more frequently in connection with other charges, e.g. Alter, Beacon, Bush, Fireball, Firebrand, &amp;c., when the term flammant, or flaming, is used. When <a  href="../e/emblazon.html">emblazoned</a> the <a href="../f/flames.html">flames</a> may be represented by <a  href="../g/gules.html">gules</a> and or alternating.</p>
