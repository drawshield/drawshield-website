<p>Fitch&eacute;(fr. fich&eacute;), fitchy, or fitched, are terms signifying <a  href="../p/point.html">pointed</a> at the lower end, they are chiefly applied to <a  href="../c/cross.html">crosses</a>, or <a  href="../c/cross/crosslet.html">crosslets</a>. See <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;19, where several examples will be found. Crosses may be simply fitch&eacute;e, that is, from the middle downwards, or only fitch&eacute;e at the foot. Crosses fitch&eacute;e of all four are mentioned by theoretical writers, but it is doubtful if examples occur. The <a  href="../p/pale.html">pale</a> has sometimes the <a  href="../t/tower.html">tower</a> terminated pointed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a pale pointed in base gules between two cinquefoils of the second--ARCHDALL, Ireland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The terms double fitched and treble fitched have been awkwardly applied by heraldic writers to crosses, the ends of which terminate as shewn in the margin. See <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;19.</p>
