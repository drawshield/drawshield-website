<h1>Fly</h1>
<p>Fly, (fr. mouche): this generic name when standing alone is probably intended to represent the common <a  href="../h/house-fly.html">house-fly</a>. Other flies will be found under the headings respectively of gadfly, silkworm-fly, and butterfly. Flies and bees, however, seem to be much confused in heraldic drawing. See also <a  href="../b/beetle.html">Beetles</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three flies or--Geoffrey de MUSCHAMP, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, 1108-1298.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per chevron sable and argent, in chief two flies of the second--LAMBERBY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three flies sable--MUSKEHAM.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, a leopard rampant regardant, and in chief three flies volant proper--PEARCE, Bp. of Bangor, 1742, afterwards of Rochester, 1756-74.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The French coats of arms add to the list the demoiselle and the cousin, that is, the dragon-fly and the the gnat.</p>
