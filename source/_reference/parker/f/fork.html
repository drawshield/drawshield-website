<h1>Fork</h1>
<p>Fork, (fr. fourche). Forks of various shapes, and varying in the number of their prongs, are borne as <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>, such as <a  href="../p/pitchfork.html">pitch-fork</a>, dung-fork, and hay-fork. The <a  href="../s/shake-fork.html">shake-fork</a> is a conventional charge, and will be found in its alphabetical order. The <a href="../f/fork.html">forks</a> used for <a href="../f/fish.html">fishing</a>, &amp;c., have been noted already under <a  href="../e/eel-spear.html">eel-spear</a>. There do not appear to be any special rules in depicting the various forks named.</p>
