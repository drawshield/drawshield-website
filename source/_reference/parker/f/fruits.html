<h1>Fruits</h1>
<p>Fruits and fruit-trees of various kinds of found as <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>, as the synopsis shews. The <a  href="../a/apple.html">apple</a>, perhaps, is the most frequently used, but it will be seen the pear and the plum, the fig and the quince, the strawberry and the cherry, the pineapple, the orange, and the pomegranate, are all found; and to these may be added the hazel-nut and the walnut, as well as one or two others. As a rule the fruit should be drawn in its natural position, i.e. <a  href="../p/pendent.html">pendent</a>. When <a href="../f/fruits.html">fruits</a> are named without any description, probably apples are intended. The term <a href="../f/fruits.html">fruited</a> or fructed(fr. fruit&eacute;) is often used, and applied not only to ordinary fruit-trees, but to the oak, almond, pine, thorn, cotton-tree, &amp;c.</p>
