<h1>Gauntlet</h1>
<p>Gauntlet: a glove of mail. The <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> form is shewn in the margin, but it is more often represented shewing the fingers. In <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a> it is necessary to distinguish between the dexter and sinister; that given in the margin being a sinister gauntlet. Gauntlets sometimes occur with separate fingers, and thus they may perhaps be represented as in the arms of VANE. An <a  href="../a/arm.html">arm</a> <a  href="../v/vambraced.html">vambraced</a> is not in general understood to have a gauntlet unless it be specially mentioned.</p>
