<p>Grass is always represented in tufts; also the old botanical terms of <a  href="../s/spire.html">spires</a> and piles applied to <a href="../g/grass.html">grass</a> are employed in one example of blazon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three pillars argent; out of each a tuft of grass or--BOSCOE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three tufts of grass vert--TYLSLEY, co, York.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three tufts of grass or--SYKES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fleur-de-lis, on the top three grass spires, each containing seven piles gules--BERNHEIM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The term <a href="../g/graminy.html">graminy</a> is also found, which signifies made of grass, and is applied to the <a  href="../c/chaplet.html">chaplet</a>, under which an example is given.</p>
