<p>Gules, (fr. gueules): the heraldic name of the <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a> <a  href="../r/red.html">red</a>. The term is probably derived from the Arabic gule, a red rose, just as the <a  href="../a/azure.html">azure</a> was derived from a word in the same language, signifying a <a  href="../b/blue.html">blue</a> <a  href="../s/stones.html">stone</a>. The <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> was, not doubt, introduced by the Crusaders. Heralds have, however, guessed it to be derived from the Latin gula, which in old French is found as gueule, i.e. the "red throat of an animal." Others, again, have tried to find the origin in the Hebrew word gulade, which signifies red cloth. Gules is denoted in engravings by numerous perpendicular lines. Heralds was blazoned by <a  href="../p/planet.html">planets</a> and jewels called it Mars, and Ruby.</p>
<p class="blazon">The name variously spelt goules, goulez, goulz, gowlys, occurs frequently in ancient rolls of arms, as will have been observed by the examples given throughout the Glossary.</p>
<p class="blazon">In the Siege of Carlaverock, as has been noticed under <a  href="../c/colours.html">Colour</a>, the terms both <a  href="../r/rouge.html">rouge</a> and vermeile are poetically used, and to these may be added rougette.</p>
