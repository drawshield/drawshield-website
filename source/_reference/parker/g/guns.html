<h1>Guns</h1>
<p>Guns: the cannon should be represented <a  href="../m/mount.html">mounted</a>, unless otherwise expressed. The <a  href="../f/field-pieces.html">field-pieces</a>, <a  href="../c/chamber-piece.html">chamber-pieces</a>(or chambers), as they are sometimes called, are varieties, but no special variation in drawing seems to be recognized, except that they are represented, as a rule, unmounted. The <a  href="../c/culverin.html">culverin</a> is a cannon with a wide bore in proportion to its length. The smaller guns will be found referred to under <a  href="../m/musket.html">Musket</a>.</p>
