<h1>Hair</h1>
<p>Hair: a lock of hair is rarely found, but a head, &amp;c., is often blazoned as having the <a href="../h/hair.html">hair</a> of a particular tincture, and more frequently the term <a  href="../c/crined.html">crined</a>(fr. <a  href="../c/cheville.html">chevel&eacute;e</a>) is used. In the case of the arms of HARBOTTLE, however, the locks should more probably be blazoned <a  href="../i/icicles.html">icicles</a>. See under <a  href="../g/gouttes.html">gouttes</a>. A <a href="../h/head.html">head</a> <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> would naturally have the hair; and if no tincture is named, brown may be used. In one case the head is blazoned bald. See <a href="../h/head.html">head</a>.</p>
