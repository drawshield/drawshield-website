<h1>Hame</h1>
<p>Hame, or Heame: the collar by which a <a href="../h/horse.html">horse</a> draws a waggon. A <a href="../h/hame.html">hame</a>(or, as some call it, a pair of hames) was the badge of the family of SAINT JOHN, supposed, in consequence, by heraldic writers to have held the office of master of the baggage-waggons. It has not been observed actually borne in any arms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Two eagles with wings expanded or, ducally crowned gules, each charged in the breast with a pair of horse-hames tied at the top and bottom proper, the inside per pale argent and of the second--Supporters of the Arms of Viscount BOLINGBROKE and ST.JOHN.</p>
