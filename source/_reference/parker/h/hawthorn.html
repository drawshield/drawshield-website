<p>Hawthorn: this bush is used in some few instances on account of its name. It was also adopted as a <a  href="../b/badge.html">badge</a> by Henry VII., and described as a hawthorn-bush regally crowned. The <a  href="../w/whitethorn.html">white-thorn</a> is found on the arms of Bishop ALDRICH, and the may-flowers probably represent the flowers of the bush. It may be <a  href="../f/fructed.html">fructed</a>, or <a  href="../f/flowers.html">flowered</a>, and the <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> also occur.</p>
