<h1>Herring</h1>
<p>Herring, (fr. hareng, old fr. hairaing), is found more especially for the sake of the play upon its name, and this from the earliest period. The cob, which also supplies a convenient pun, is probably meant for a young herring, though the term is used for the young of other fish.</p>

<p class="blazon">Of the same family(clupeid&oelig;) as <a href="../h/herring.html">herring</a> are other fishes which are named in heraldry, viz. the <a  href="../s/sprats.html">sprat</a>, the <a  href="../g/garvin.html">garvin</a>, and, on account of the name of the bearer, the spalding, which is perhaps, after all, but a local name. There is also the pilchard(Germ. pelzer, lat. clupea pilchardus) of the same family.</p>
