<h1>Hook</h1>
<p>Hook: it will, perhaps, be better to group under one head the chief varieties of <a href="../h/hook.html">hooks</a>, though they are used for various purposes. They may be enumerated as follows:--</p>
<p class="blazon">Boat-hook: this occurs in but one coat of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, an annulet beset with three boat-hooks in triangle sable--BROBACH.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/330a.png" alt="Fish-hook." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Fish-hook.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../f/fish-hook.html">Fish-hook</a>: this occurs in at least two coats of arms, and the cross hame&ccedil;on, (see <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;22), is supposed to have its termination in the form of <a  href="../f/fish-hook.html">fish hooks</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a chevron between three fish-hooks argent--MEDVILLE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse sable between three fish-hooks gules--PENKERCH, co. Lincoln; also BOSDON.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/330b.png" alt="Flesh-hooks." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Flesh-hooks.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">Flesh-hook: a fork for the purpose of taking meat from the cauldron. The first figure is perhaps the more correct in form. The second figure is sometimes erroneously blazoned a <a  href="../p/pike-staff.html">Pike-staff</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse between three flesh-hooks sable--PENKERIDGE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three flesh-hooks(fig. 2) sable, two and one--WALLEY.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/330c.png" alt="KETTLER." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">KETTLER.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../p/pothook.html">Pot-hooks</a>, which appear to be the same as the <a href="../h/hanger.html">hangers</a> are borne only by German families; at least no example with a true English name has been observed. One of the forms it takes is given in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a hanger, or kettle-iron, expanded gules--KETTLER.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a double-hooked hanger closed in pale sable--ZERTSCHEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon"><a  href="../r/rope-hook.html">Rope-hook</a>: this occur in but one coat of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron azure between three rope-hooks sable--ROPE-MAKERS' Company, Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/331a.png" alt="Tenter-hooks." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Tenter-hooks.</figcaption></figure>

<a id="331"></a><p class="blazon"><a  href="../t/tenter-hook.html">Tenter-hook</a>: two forms of this charge occur, as shewn in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable three tenter-hooks argent--CLARKE, or CLERKES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three tenter-hooks sable--CLARK.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse between three tenter-hooks sable--PENERECHE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, two tenter-hooks[elsewhere harts' horns] in saltire sable--LACHAULT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Thatcher's-hook: this appears to be borne by two branches of the family of CHOWNE, according to the blazon. But the drawing is so vague, that they have been blazoned in one case as <a  href="../s/stag.html">stag's</a> <a  href="../a/attire.html">attires</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three thatcher's hooks in fesse argent--CHOWNE, Kent.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three thatcher's hooks in pale argent--CHOWNE, Berks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">See also <a  href="../s/sickle.html">Sickle</a> called sometimes a <a  href="../p/pruning-hook.html">pruning-hook</a>; <a href="../h/horse-picker.html">Horsepicker</a>, called erroneously a hay-hook. The <a  href="../s/shavehook.html">shave-hook</a> is given under <a  href="../p/plumbers-implements.html">Plumbers' implements</a>.</p>
