<h1>Horns of animals</h1>
<p>Horns of animals, (fr. cornes): the horns of stags(attires, q.v.), though generally affixed to the head or the scalp, are at times borne separately, but such arms appear to be, as a rule, of foreign origin. Of other animals only the cow's <a href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> have been noticed as borne separately.</p>
