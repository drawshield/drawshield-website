<h1>Humetty</h1>
<p>Humetty, (fr. al&eacute;s&eacute;), is a term applied to certain ordinaries instead of <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a>, which is applied to <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>, and especially those of animals . Applied to the <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> and the bar, humetty signifies that both ends are cut off so as not to reach to the edge of the shield. Applied to <a  href="../c/cross.html">crosses</a>(see <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;7) and saltires, all four ends are so treated; and when there is more than one of either of these in the same <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> they are to be drawn humetty, though it be not expressed. It does not appear that a bend is ever humetty, and the single bendlet so treated would be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> a <a  href="../b/baton.html">baton</a>, q.v. Nor has any example been observed of a pale or pile so blazoned; the <a  href="../c/chevron.html">chevron</a> and the pallet are sometimes <a  href="../c/couped.html">couped</a>, but the term <a href="../h/humetty.html">humetty</a> seems not to be applied to them.</p>
