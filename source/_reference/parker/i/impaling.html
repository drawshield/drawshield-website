<p>Impaling: the meaning and object of the impaling or setting side by side two coats of arms or more in the same <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> will be found explained under <a  href="../m/marshalling.html">marshalling</a>, as well as some of the chief rules laid down by heralds respecting the process. An example is here given from a monument which once existed in Dorchester Church, Oxon, which is thus blazoned by Antony &agrave; Wood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Lozengie argent and vert; on a chevron gules three bezants; on a chief gules a goat's head erased between two cinquefoils or; Impaling, (1) Or, on a chevron between three choughs gules, a crescent or; (2) Azure, three hatchets or--William YOUNG and Alicia his wife, which died, May 15, 1430. [Wood does not given the name of the second wife.]</p>

<p class="blazon">It will be observed that the ordinaries, or charges, have to be drawn, as a rule, smaller, or at least narrower, than when then whole shield is occupied; and what is particularly to be noticed is that when a <a  href="../b/bordure.html">bordure</a>, or an <a  href="../o/orle.html">orle</a>, or <a  href="../t/tressure.html">tressure</a> occurs, it is, as a rule, not continued round the side where the impaling takes place; it may be said to be(but not blazoned as) couped by the line of impalement. The example given in the margin represents the arms of John KEMP, Abp. of Canterbury, 1452.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a pastoral staff in pale or, ensigned with a cross patt&eacute;e argent, surmounted by a pall of the last, edged and fringed of the second, charged with four crosses patt&eacute;e fitch&eacute;e sable, for CANTERBURY; impaled with Gules, three garbes within a bordure engrailed or, for KEMP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Other illustrations of Impaling will be found under <a  href="../m/marshalling.html">Marshalling</a>. It will, as a rule, readily be distinguished form Party per pale.</p>
