<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/341a.png" alt="MARKHAM." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">MARKHAM.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Issant, or Issuant: arising from the bottom line of a <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a> or chief, or from the upper line of a <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a>, or from a coronet. Naissant, a term with which issuant is often confounded, has a somewhat different signification, namely, when the figure rises from the midst of the chief, or fesse, or other charge. Issuing from the side of the shield is also found; and this is perhaps the same as the French mouvant. See under <a  href="../a/arm.html">Arm</a>, <a  href="../a/aspect.html">Aspect</a>, &amp;c.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a chief or, a demi-lion rampant issuant gules--MARKHAM, Notts.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a fesse gules, a demi-lion issuing therefrom sable--CHALMERS, Scotland.</p>
