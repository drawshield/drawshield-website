<h1>Jessant</h1>
<p>Jessant, (fr. issant), shooting or giving forth: is often used for issuant, and sometimes, though erroneously, for naissant. The term is chiefly applied to the <a  href="../f/fleur-de-lis.html">fleur-de-lis</a>, and the phrase jessant-de-lis is used with respect to a leopard's <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> having a <a  href="../f/fleur-de-lis.html">fleur-de-lis</a> passing through it, as in the insignia of the See of HEREFORD; though there seems to be some doubt whether the reversing of the leopard's <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> was not by accident, since in the reign of Edward III. the blazon makes no mention of the fact.</p>
