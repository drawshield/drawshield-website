<h1>Kingfisher</h1>
<p>Kingfisher: this bird seems to be borne by at least two families, and in one branch of the second family it is, oddly enough, blazoned <a  href="../g/gules.html">gules</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per fesse argent and azure a pale counterchanged three kingfishers of the second--HONYTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, three kingfishers proper--FISHER, London.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, a kingfisher close gules--FYSHER, co. Bedford.</p>
</blockquote>
