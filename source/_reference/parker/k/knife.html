<p>Knife: knives are not unfrequently borne in arms, but they have generally some precise designation, e.g. the <a  href="../s/shoemakers-knife.html">shoemaker's knife</a>, the pruning knife, and the shredding knife, but it is difficult to find good examples to shew the correct drawing. In the insignia of CROWLAND Abbey they are sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as S.Bartholomew's knives.</p>
<p class="blazon">The plumber's <a  href="../c/cutting-knife.html">cutting-knife</a>, and the patten-maker's <a  href="../c/cutting-knife.html">cutting-knife</a>, and the currier's <a  href="../p/paring-knife.html">paring-knife</a>, will be found beneath their respective heads.</p>
<p class="blazon">Butchers' knives are borne by the foreign families of KOHLER, KROSIG, and WINCKEL in Saxony, but no English examples have been noticed.</p>
