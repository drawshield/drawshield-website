<h1>Landscapes</h1>
<p>Landscapes: several views and landscapes, with skies and sea, have been gradually introduced into modern heraldry, but it is needless to say that their introduction in an absolute departure from the principles by which the choice of ancient devices was guided. Perhaps one of the first to adopt the innovation was the Trinity House; but other companies did the same, and then Indian and naval officers followed suit, with scenes in India or sea pieces.

<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a cross gules, between four ships of three masts each under full sail all proper; on each sail, pennant, and ensign, a cross gules, and each quarter painted as a sea-piece with sky, sea, &amp;c., all proper--TRINITY HOUSE Guild or Confraternity[Inc. 1515].</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a globe whereon are represented the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn, all proper; in the sinister chief point two herrings hauriant in saltire argent, crowned or; on a canton the united arms of Great Britain of the second--SOUTH SEA Company, established by Act of Parliament, 1712.</p>
