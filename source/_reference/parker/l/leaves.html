<h1>Leaves</h1>
<p>Leaves, (fr. feuilles): such as <a  href="../o/oak.html">oak</a>, <a  href="../h/holly.html">holly</a>, <a href="../l/laurel.html">laurel</a>, or <a  href="../b/bay.html">bay</a>, and more especially the last, are the more usual; but it will be seen that many other leaves are borne, and besides those which are mentioned by name, sometimes <a href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> simply, when probably laurel-leaves are meant. The <a href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> on the arms of LYNDEWODE are blazoned <a href="../l/linden-leaves.html">linden-leaves</a>, and are supposed to be those of the lime-tree. What leaf is meant by the gletver named in the Roll of Arms as borne by SIR JOHN DE LISLE is very doubtful: possibly the cleaver-leaf(a name given to the galium aperinum) may be intended. Care should be taken accurately to describe the position of the leaf, which is generally <a  href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>. In French arms leaves are sometimes veined(nerv&eacute;s) of another tincture.</p>
