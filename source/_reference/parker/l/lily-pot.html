<h1>Lily-pot</h1>
<p>Lily-pot, or flower-pot. Although the example figured in the margin in blazoned as if holding gilly-flowers, they were, no doubt, meant for lilies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Vert, a flower-pot argent, with gilly flowers gules, leaved of the first--NEW INN, or OUR LADY'S INN, London.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three lily-pots[? covered cups] argent--ARGENTYNE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a pot of lilies argent--The Royal Burgh of DUNDEE.</p>
</blockquote>
