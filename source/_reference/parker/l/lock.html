<p>Lock: the form of this charge varies; it is generally <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as a <a  href="../p/padlock.html">padlock</a>(fr. cadenas), sometimes a <a  href="../q/quadrangular.html">quadrangular</a> <a href="../l/lock.html">lock</a>. The more frequent form, however, is the fetterlock, of which drawings have already been given.</p>
