<p>Lozengy, (fr. losang&eacute;): entirely covered with <a href="../l/lozenge.html">lozenges</a> of <a  href="../a/alternate.html">alternate</a> <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tinctures</a>. The lines are variously drawn, but as a rule they should produce lozenges narrower in breadth in proportion to their length than in the example drawn to illustrate what bendy, dexter and sinister would produce, yet not so narrow as fusilly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Lozengy, argent and gules--FITZ-WILLIAM, co. Northampton.</p>
<p class="blazon">Lozengy, gules and or--CROME, London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <a href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a>, however, has come to have the meaning of 'composed of lozenges,' that is when only one tincture is given(see what has been said under <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>,  &sect;8). It is contended that this is legitimate, and thus some writers used the term <a href="../l/lozenge.html">lozenge</a> instead of <a href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a>, e.g. a <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a> <a href="../l/lozenge.html">lozenge</a>; further it is laid down that in this case care should be taken that the lozenges at the termination are not drawn entire so as to distinguish the bearing from a fesse of so many lozenges. It is doubtful, however, if these distinctions have been much regarded in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a bend lozengy argent--William de RALEIGH, Bp. of Norwich, 1239-1242; Bp. of Winchester, 1244-1250.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a pale lozengy sable--SAVAGE, Bp. of Rochester, 1493; of London, 1496-1501.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../l/lozengy.html">Lozengy</a> may also be combined with other lines of diversity, e.g. <a  href="../b/bendy.html">bendy</a> <a href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a>(q.v. under <a  href="../b/bendy.html">Bendy</a>); <a  href="../b/barry.html">barry</a> <a  href="../b/bendy.html">bendy</a> <a href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a> also occurs(see under <a  href="../b/bar.html">Bar</a>), but the word is redundant since barry bendy produces the lozenge form. So also <a  href="../p/paly.html">paly</a> <a href="../l/lozengy.html">lozengy</a> is not needed since bendy paly produces the lozenge form. At the same time the diagonal lines may be drawn less acutely, and the result may give more the idea of paly lozengy. [See figure under <a  href="../p/paly.html">paly</a> <a  href="../b/bendy.html">bendy</a>.]</p>
