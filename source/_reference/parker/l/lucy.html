<h1>Lucy</h1>
<p>Lucy, or Luce, (old fr. luc and luz): the fish now commonly called a <a  href="../p/pike.html">pike</a>. The merlucius, or pike of the sea, is the hake. See under <a  href="../c/cod.html">Cod</a>.</p>
<center><pre>    "And many a breme, and many a luce in stew."                                
      Chaucer, Prologue, 352.                                                   
</pre></center>
<p class="blazon">It is, as will be seen, found frequently in ancient arms, where it plays upon the names. The large head and long mouth distinguish it in the drawing from other fishes. In early arms lucies seem to have been always haurient; as they are not so now it is necessary to note the position.</p>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../g/ged.html">Ged</a> is but another name for the <a href="../l/lucy.html">lucy</a>, and is equally used as a canting charge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three geds haurient argent--GED of that Ilk.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, two geds in saltire argent--GEDNEY, Hudderley, Linc. [Crest, two geds as in the arms.]</p>

<p class="blazon">Gules, an escutcheon between three luce's heads couped argent--GEDDES, Tweeddale. [Elsewhere, between three ged's or pike's heads couped or.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The name <a  href="../p/pike.html">Pike</a>(fr. brochet), though not properly used by <a  href="../h/herald.html">heralds</a>, is obviously intended by the following canting coats of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three luces[or pikes] naiant within a bordure engrailed argent--PIKE, London.</p>
<p class="blazon">Per pale argent and gules, on a chevron between three trefoils slipped a luce naiant all counterchanged--PYKE, Devonshire.</p>

<p class="blazon">D'azur, au brochet d'argent surmont&eacute; d'une &eacute;toile d'or--LUC-FONTENAY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Possibly the Sea-pike or Gar-fish may be intended in the crest of the GARLING family. The two Sea-lucies borne on arms of the Stock-fishmongers' Company are probably meant for Hakes(q.v. under <a  href="../c/cod.html">Cod</a>).</p>
