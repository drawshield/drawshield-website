<p>Lymphad, or Galley: an ancient ship with one mast, not unfrequent in the heraldry of Scotland. The accompanying figure is copied from a Scottish MS., circ. 1580, in which it is given(sable, in a field or) as <a  href="../q/quartered.html">quartered</a> by the <a  href="../e/earl.html">Earl</a> of Argyll. It is the feudal ensign of the lordship of LORNE; but it is usually drawn in a different form, and in a field argent. See also under <a  href="../s/ship.html">Ship</a>.</p>
