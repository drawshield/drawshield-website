<p>Mace, (Civic): this device, derived from the insignia of the office of the Mayor, is borne occasionally in coats of arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per chevron ermine and azure; in chief a plume of three ostrich feathers argent between two chaplets vert with roses gules; in base a civic mace, enclosed by the collar of the Lord Mayor of London, or--Sir James DUKE, Lord Mayor of London, 1848.</p>
<p class="blazon">..... A[? verger's] mace in bend dexter surmounted of a pastoral staff in bend sinister ..... BIRDE, Bp. of Bangor, 1539; afterwards of Chester, 1542-54.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The fr. Masse d'armes is a weapon, and somewhat similar to the club called <a href="../m/massue.html">Massue</a>, the latter term being in French armory more frequently employed. See under <a  href="../s/staff.html">Staff</a>.</p>
