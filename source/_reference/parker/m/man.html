<h1>Man</h1>
<p>Man: although not found in early arms, in later arms the human figure is found represented in all varieties. The <a href="../m/man.html">man</a> in armour has already been noted as frequent, especially as a <a  href="../s/supporters.html">supporter</a>: no less frequent is the Savage, or, as he is indifferently termed, the Wild-man, or Wood-man, a man wreathed about the head and loins with <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a>, and generally carrying a club.</p>
<a id="389"></a><p class="blazon">The <a href="../m/man.html">man</a> is frequently represented naked, or sometimes only vested round the loins, as in the case of the Savage. The <a  href="../w/watchman.html">Watchman</a>, in the arms of the town of WARWICK, would be represented as a soldier. In the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of the <a href="../m/miner.html">MINERS'</a> COMPANY the miner is described(see <a href="../m/mine.html">Mine</a>), but more minutely in the description of the supporters of the arms of that Company(see below). Men are also frequently referred to be their nationality, e.g. an <a  href="../a/african.html">African</a>, a <a  href="../n/negro.html">Negro</a>(see under <a  href="../c/cinnamon.html">Cinnamon</a>), a Moor, a Blackamoor, an Indian, a Beloochee Soldier, a Danish Warrior, &amp;c., &amp;c. A <a href="../m/man.html">man</a> may also be represented in various positions, e.g. in one coat hanging on a gallows. See under <a  href="../a/armour.html">Armour</a>, also under <a  href="../h/head.html">Head</a>.</p>
