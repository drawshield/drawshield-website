<p>Masculyn: there is a curious figure composed of a single mascle with the ends terminating in fleurs-de-lis, to which the name seems to have been given in one instance of masculyn fleur-de-lis&eacute;(i.q. fleury).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a masculyn fleur-de-lys&eacute; or, within and without five young men's heads couped argent crined or--Henry MAN, Bp. of Sodor and Man, 1546-56[Harl. MS. 5846].</p>
