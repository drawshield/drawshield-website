<h1>Metal</h1>
<p>Metal: (1.) The <a href="../m/metal.html">metals</a> employed as <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tinctures</a> in heraldry are two in number, that is say or and argent. See <a  href="../t/tincture.html">Tinctures</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">(2.) Blocks of metal are frequently introduced into heraldry, and are called by different names, and are generally conventionally represented. We find <a  href="../i/ingots-of-gold.html">ingots of gold</a>, cakes of copper, blocks of tin, and pigs of lead. We also find a <a href="../m/mineral.html">mineral</a> named, viz. the <a  href="../c/calamine-stone.html">calamine stone</a>.</p>
