<h1>Mitre</h1>

<p>Mitre, (fr. Mitre): one of the principal insignia of the episcopal office, although not belonging to it exclusively. There were three kinds of <a href="../m/mitre.html">Mitres</a> recognized by old writers--the precious, the 'aurifraged,' and the simple.</p>
<p class="blazon">The privilege of wearing a mitre was first conceded to abbots and priors about the eleventh century. Soon afterwards it was decreed that mitred abbots exempt from episcopal jurisdiction should wear the second mitre mentioned above, the third being assigned to non-exempt abbots and priors. These rules do not appear to have ever been very strictly observed or enforced. It is the first which is always represented in heraldic drawing.</p>
<p class="blazon">Though the use of the mitre as a part of the episcopal costume had, until quite recently <a>, become obsolete in the Anglican Church, its prelates have continued to bear in above their arms. The </a><a href="../m/mitre.html">mitres</a> of the two archbishops, and the Bishop of Durham, are sometimes encircled with ducal coronets, which, however, is, at least in the two former cases, a practice of late origin, and without authority. The <a  href="../b/bishop.html">Bishop</a> of Durham might(until lately) with propriety enjoy this mark of temporal dignity, as he was Count Palatine of Durham. His mitre in the sixteenth century was represented with a <a  href="../p/plume.html">plume</a> of <a  href="../o/ostrich.html">ostrich</a> <a  href="../f/feathers.html">feathers</a> issuing from the sinister side and with the <a  href="../c/coronet.html">coronet</a>.</p>

<a id="410"></a><p class="blazon">The annexed figure of a mitre is taken from a roll of the peers of England, date 1515. The abbots' <a href="../m/mitre.html">mitres</a> drawn in that document are precisely similar in form, but differ in the colour of the enclosed triangular spaces. Earlier mitres were generally lower: in later times they have usually been represented much higher and more acutely pointed. It all cases they should be represented with the <a  href="../l/label.html">labels</a>, or <a  href="../p/pendent.html">pendent</a> ribbons at the sides of the mitre. Sometimes the term <a  href="../s/stringed.html">stringed</a> is applied to these when denoting their tincture.</p>
<p class="blazon">As charges, mitres occur in the insignia of several English sees and abbeys, and previous to the introduction of the practice of bishops impaling the insignia of their sees, they often differenced their paternal arms by the addition of mitres, keys, or other official insignia within the shield.</p>
