<h1>Neptune</h1>
<p>Neptune. One coat of arms has the figure of Neptune thus minutely described, believed to have reference to an escape from shipwreck.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a Neptune crowned with an Eastern crown of gold, his Trident sable headed or, issuing from a stormy ocean, the sinister hand grasping the head of a ship's mast appearing above the waves as part of the wreck, all proper; on a chief azure, the arctic polar star of the first between two water bougets of the second--HEARD, co. Somerset[Lancaster Herald, afterwards Garter King of Arms, granted 1762].</p>
