<h1>Net</h1>
<p>Net, (fr. reseau, old fr. rets): in one Scotch coat a fisherman's <a href="../n/net.html">net</a> occurs, but it is suggested by heralds that the term <a  href="../f/fret.html">fret</a>, or rather fretty, should be used to represent the nets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The field a sea proper, a net argent suspended from the dexter chief point and the sinister fesse point to the base; in chief two and in base three herrings entangled in the net--Burgh of INVERERA, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, fretty[otherwise a fret] argent--HARINGTON.</p>
</blockquote>
