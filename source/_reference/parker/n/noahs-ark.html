<h1>Noah's Ark</h1>
<p>Noah's Ark, (fr. Arche de No&eacute;): this device is singularly chosen for more than one coat of arms, both of English and French families. It is generally represented <a  href="../f/float.html">floating</a> on the waters of the deluge, and in chief a dove flying, bearing in its beak the olive-branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, an ark in the water proper surmounted by a dome azure standing thereon and holding in the beak an olive-branch vert, all between three gilly-flowers gules stalked and leaved of the fourth--JOLLY, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, in a sea in base the Ark of Noah, and in chief a dove volant with an olive-branch in the beak all proper--GALLIEZ, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, an antique hulk, the stern terminating with the head of a dragon; in the hulk the ark with three doors in the side; from the ark against the side a stepladder all or; on a chief argent the Cross of S.George gules; charged in the centre with a lion passant gardant of the second--SHIPWRIGHTS' Company[Inc. 1605].</p>
