<h1>Oak</h1>
<p>Oak, (fr. ch&ecirc;ne): this tree very frequently finds a place in arms, especially in those in which the bearer's name admits of a meaning connected with it. Sometimes the whole tree is borne, sometimes the <a  href="../b/branch.html">branches</a>, sometimes <a  href="../s/sprig.html">sprigs</a>, <a  href="../s/slip.html">slips</a>, <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a>, &amp;c., sometimes the <a  href="../a/acorn.html">acorns</a>, q.v., and more frequently the tree is fructed, i.e. with the <a  href="../a/acorn.html">acorns</a> of a different tincture.</p>
<p class="blazon">In one of the earliest rolls of arms the term <a  href="../k/kene.html">kene</a> occurs, which has been thought to be ch&ecirc;ne, from the name of the bearer being ORSTEDE. In the same <a  href="../r/roll.html">Roll</a> <a  href="../f/fourche.html">fourch&eacute;</a> au kanee, in the arms borne by LEXINGTON, has been supposed to be forked like an <a href="../o/oak.html">oak</a> <a  href="../b/branch.html">branch</a>.
