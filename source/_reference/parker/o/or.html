<p>Or, (fr. from Latin aurum): the chief of the tinctures, i.e. <a  href="../g/gold.html">gold</a>. It is called <a  href="../s/sol.html">Sol</a> by those who blazon by the sun and planets, Topaz(or Carbuncle) by those who have fancifully taken the names of precious stones. Engravers represent it by an indefinite number of small points. The term <a  href="../g/gold.html">Gold</a> is not unfrequently used by <a  href="../h/herald.html">heralds</a> to avoid repetition, and the French word Jaune, i.e. <a  href="../y/yellow.html">yellow</a>, is met with in old heraldic poetry. For instance, at the Siege of Carlaverock instead of Or, a lion azure, we find:--</p>
<center><pre>    HENRI DE PERCI, son nevou ...           Fu sa baner bien vuable             
    Jaune o un bleu lyon rampant              Roll of Carlaverock.              
</pre></center>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Jaune, o crois rouge engreelie--EUSTACE DE HACHE--Ibid.</p>
