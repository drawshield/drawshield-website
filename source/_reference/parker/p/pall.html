<h1>Pall</h1>
<p>Pall, (fr. pairle, which is also occasionally used by English heralds):</p>
<p class="blazon">1. As a charge it represents an ecclesiastical vestment known as the pallium, and symbolical of Archiepiscopal authority, e.g. the <a href="../p/pall.html">Pall</a> was sent by Pope Gregory to Augustine in 601; see Beda, Bk. I. cap. 29. Also to Abp. Justus in 624; Ibid., Bk. II. cap. 8. In the East, however, it occurs as an episcopal ornament.</p>
<p class="blazon">When borne as a <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>, e.g. in the arms of archbishops, the lower end is always couped and fringed.</p>

<p class="blazon">Argent, a bishop's pall sable; in chief a stag's head erased gules--CUNNINGHAME, Scotland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Similar insignia to those borne by the See of CANTERBURY were formerly borne by the See of YORK, but with the <a  href="../f/field.html">field</a> <a  href="../g/gules.html">gules</a>. Those of ARMAGH are the same as Canterbury, and those of DUBLIN have one more cross.</p>
<p class="blazon">2. As a sub-ordinary the <a href="../p/pall.html">pall</a> may be described as a figure of the shape of the letter <b>Y</b>.</p>
<p class="blazon">All three arms are to be drawn throughout. The figure with the three arms couped and pointed would be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as the <a  href="../s/shake-fork.html">Shakefork</a>, q.v.</p>

<a id="440"></a><p class="blazon">A <a href="../p/pall.html">pall</a> is but rarely subject to modification like the <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinaries</a>. In one case it is reversed in another patonce. The term <a  href="../c/cross.html">cross</a> <a href="../p/pall.html">pall</a> also occurs which cannot be a cross at all, but is supposed to mean merely the pall used as a subordinary, that is with the members drawn throughout.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a pall reversed ermine--KELVERDON, or KELDON, Essex.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a pall[ending in points] patonce between three estoiles argent--HARROLD.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a cross pall, argent--DEYCHETER, Germany.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The terms per pall and in pall also occur, but they are written with the French form per pairle and in pairle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per pairle reversed or gules and ermine over all a tau azure--LYLSEY, Harl. MS. 1386, fo. 66.</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, three swords in pairle hilts meeting in the centre argent--BRISAC.</p>
