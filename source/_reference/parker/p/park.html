<p>Park: the idea of a park is a circular space enclosed with <a href="../p/pales.html">pales</a>, and having a <a  href="../g/gate.html">gate</a> in front. Park pales are usually represented as in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a mount vert, a stag lodged within park pales and gate all proper--Town of DERBY.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, on a mount vert issuing from park palings with gate proper a lion rampant or holding in the dexter paw a scimetar all proper; on a chief indented sable two lions rampant argent--BURE; quartering Davis, Higford, and Scudamore.</p>
<p class="blazon">A pine-tree or, leaved vert, fructed proper, enclosed with pales argent and sable, nails counterchanged--Crest of PINFOLD, co. Bedford.</p>
