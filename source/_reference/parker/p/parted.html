<p>Parted is not strictly a heraldic term, but it is used by some writers in compounds such as <a  href="../b/biparted.html">biparted</a>, <a  href="../t/triparted.html">triparted</a>, &amp;c. The term is applied to the <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>, see  &sect;8. Biparted has also been used to signify notching, as in the margin, and triparted has been used for the French tierc&eacute;, but none of these terms are needed, and do not occur in any correct blazon.</p>
<p>Parted. See <a href="../p/party.html">Party</a>.</p>
