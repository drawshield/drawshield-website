<p>Passion, Implements of the: so many coats of arms were connected directly or indirectly with religious institutions, that it is not surprising that the Implements of the Passion were pressed into the service of Heraldry. The most frequent, however, are the Passion nails(fr. clous de la Passion): they are generally drawn square and with a pyramidical head. The <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a> of <a  href="../c/calvary.html">Calvary</a> has already been referred to,  &sect;15. In carvings, both in wood and stone, the Implements of the Passion are very frequently represented on shields, but as religious, not heraldic, symbols. It may be added that some heralds have gone so far as to ascribe coat-armour to our Lord, in which all the various implements of the Passion are pourtrayed. But such in an instance only of the abuse of heraldry, not its use.</p>
