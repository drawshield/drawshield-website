<h1>Peascods</h1>
<p>Peascods appear in one or two coats of arms. These of HARDBEAN seem to arise from an error in blazon(see <a  href="../b/beans.html">Bean</a>). The term pea-rise for pea-stalk with <a  href="../l/leaves.html">leaves</a> and flowers is given by heraldic writers, but its use in blazon has not been observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a fesse azure between three roses in chief gules and as many peascods, in base vert a sword barways of the first hilt and pomel or--COLLISON, Auchloumes; COLLISONE, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a crescent gules between three peascods fesswise vert--HARDBEANE or HATBEANE.</p>
