<p>Pheon, or Pheon head, written also <a  href="../f/feon.html">feon</a>: the head of a dart, barbed, and engrailed on the inner side; the broad arrow being in this respect plain. Its position is with the <a href="../p/point.html">point</a> downward, unless otherwise blazoned. The French synonym is perhaps fer de fleche, but fer de lance, fer de javelot, and fer de hallebarde are also similar.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../p/pheon.html">Pheons</a> are occasionally borne <a  href="../s/shafted.html">shafted</a> and feathered.</p>
