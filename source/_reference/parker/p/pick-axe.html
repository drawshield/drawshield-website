<h1>Pick-axe</h1>
<p>Pick-axe: in has been supposed that the old French pieces in the following arms may mean picks or pick-axes, in allusion to the name of the bearer rather than to the natural meaning of the expression, viz. <a  href="../s/silver.html">silver</a> coins. See also under <a  href="../a/axe.html">Axe</a>.</p>
