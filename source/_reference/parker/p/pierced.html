<h1>Pierced</h1>
<p>Pierced, (fr. perc&eacute;): applied to any bearing which is perforated, the tincture of the field or charged on which it is placed being seen through the aperture, (fr. ajour&eacute;). If a different tincture be seen it should be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a  href="../v/voided.html">voided</a>. See e.g. examples under <a  href="../m/mullet.html">Mullet</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">As to the form of the aperture it is doubtful as regards the ancient arms whether it should be circular, or should follow the outline of the <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a>. In modern arms pierced implies a circular aperture, though Crosses are sometimes <a  href="../s/square-pierced.html">square pierced</a>, and <a  href="../l/lozenge.html">lozenge</a> <a href="../p/pierced.html">pierced</a>. See  &sect;9, and  &sect;5; and voided is used when the aperture follows the outline.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../p/pierced.html">Pierced</a> with an <a  href="../a/arrow.html">arrow</a> generally means the same as <a  href="../t/transfixed.html">transfixed</a>. A singular, and perhaps single, instance of an ordinary <a href="../p/pierced.html">piercing</a> or perforating another is:--</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Or, chevron gules pierced with[or perforated by] a bend ermine[otherwise a bend ermine perforating a chevron gules]--HODSTOKE, or HADSTOCK, Suffolk.</p>
