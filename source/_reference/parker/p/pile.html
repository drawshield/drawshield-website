<h1>Pile</h1>
<p>Pile, (fr. pile): an ordinary which has been supposed to represent a stake used in construction of a military bridge, but may well have had its origin like the <a href="../p/pale.html">pale</a>, <a  href="../f/fesse.html">fesse</a>, or <a  href="../b/bend.html">bend</a> in the constructive details of the shield. As will be seen, there are various forms of the name, and it is subjected also to <a  href="../d/differences.html">difference</a> in outline. The <a  href="../c/charge.html">charge</a> is found frequently in the old rolls of arms.</p>

<a id="458"></a><p class="blazon">According to the somewhat arbitrary rules of later heralds, a single pile uncharged should occupy one third of the breadth of the chief, but if charged it may be double that width. Piles are to be drawn in a perpendicular position, with the <a href="../p/point.html">points</a> downwards, reaching to, or nearly to, the base point, unless otherwise directed; but they are to be found in bend and in fesse, and it is not uncommon to designate some point in the edge of the shield from which they should start, and one at which they should end, unless they are to be drawn throughout. The <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a> in consequently often very intricate, as will be seen from the examples. If the pile is simply reversed, i.e. with the <a href="../p/point.html">point</a> upwards, it is blazoned as <a  href="../t/transposed.html">transposed</a>. When a <a href="../p/pile.html">pile</a> is pierced it is said that a lozenge shape is intended.</p>

<p class="blazon">The term in pile and per pile are both used: the former in reference to a number of charges, six at least, being arranged in the shape of a pile, though with so few, the formula of 'three, two, and one,' really amounts to the same thing; the latter involves the shield being divided into three parts by the two lines being drawn pilewise.</p>
