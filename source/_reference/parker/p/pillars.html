<h1>Pillars</h1>
<p>Pillars: details of buildings are but rarely introduced into heraldry, but when <a href="../p/pillars.html">pillars</a> occur they somewhat resemble columns of the Tuscan order; <a href="../p/plain.html">plain</a> Norman shafts with <a  href="../c/cushion.html">cushion</a> <a  href="../c/capital.html">capitals</a>, however, are sometimes to be found. The <a  href="../c/capital.html">capital</a>, the <a  href="../b/base.html">base</a>, and the <a href="../p/pedestal.html">pedestal</a> are sometimes mentioned in the blazon. See also <a  href="../a/arch.html">Arches</a>.</p>
