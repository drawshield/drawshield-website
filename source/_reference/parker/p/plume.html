<p>Plume. Feathers were naturally employed more frequently as <a  href="../b/badge.html">badges</a> and crests than as <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a> on coats of arms, and when three or more occur they are termed a <a href="../p/plume.html">plume</a>, fr. panache. The best known example is the plume of ostrich feathers borne by the PRINCE OF WALES, a cognizance peculiar to members of the royal family. The favourite legend that Prince Edward received the ostrich feathers from the casque of John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, at the battle of Cressy, Aug. 26, 1346, will scarcely bear investigation, or that the motto Ich Dien referred referred to the Bohemian King serving the French King as a stipendiary; still the true origin has not been satisfactorily ascertained. Since the time of Henry VIII. the ostrich feathers have been encircled by a coronet. An illustration is given from the Prince's Primer, printed by Richard Grafton, London, 1546.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron sable between three ostrich feathers(erroneously called perukes)--HARMAN, Kent.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a cross moline gules a feather of the first between two annulets in pale or--VIDAL, co. Devon.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a steel cap proper with a feather in front gules--KINGSTON, temp. RICH. II.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, six ostrich feathers, three, two, and one sable--JERVIS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">When a <a href="../p/plume.html">plume</a> consists of more than three feathers the number must be stated, but a very common <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> is to place the feathers in rows, and the rows are by some heralds blazoned as so many heights. When more than three heights occur, the term <a href="../p/pyramid-of-feathers.html">pyramid of feathers</a> is used. The <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> of <a  href="../m/mortier.html">MORTIMER</a> supplies an example of this, though some heralds blazon this device as a pyramid of leaves.</p>

<p class="blazon">Sometimes a single feather is borne, and this not unfrequently is passed through an escroll, e.g. in the badge of JOHN OF GAUNT, as well as on his <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a>. See also <a href="../p/pen.html">Pen</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">In case the quill should differ in tincture from the rest of the feather, the term <a href="../p/penne.html">penned</a>, <a  href="../q/quilled.html">quilled</a>, or <a  href="../s/shafted.html">shafted</a>, may be employed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three ostrich feathers ermine quills or, transfixed through as many scrolls of the last--JOHN duke of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three feathers in pale, each bending from the other in the tops gules, shafts[or quills] or--BROBRACH.</p>
