<h1>Potent</h1>
<p>Potent: this was the name anciently given to a <a  href="../c/crutch.html">crutch</a>, or walking staff. Thus Chaucer, in his description of 'Elde,' that is, old age, says,--</p>
<center><pre>    "So olde she was, that she ne went      A fote, but it were by potent."     
</pre></center>
<p class="blazon">In English blazon the term Pilgrim's <a  href="../c/crutch.html">crutch</a>, q.v., is more frequently used than crutch, but in some French arms the word potent seems to be used in this sense, or perhaps for a tau cross.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three bars gules; over all a crutch in bend sinister or--Gilbertson Priory at MALTON, co. York.</p>
<p class="blazon">D'or, &agrave; trois potences de gueules--MARCHALACH, Bretagne.</p>

<p class="blazon">1. The term is most frequently used in connection with the <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a>, where the four arms end in a crutch-like form. See <a  href="../c/cross/potent.html">Cross potent</a>,  &sect;31.</p>
<p class="blazon">2. But it also gives its name to one of the heraldic furs, composed of any metal and colour; this is, however, usually blazoned <a href="../p/potent.html">Potent</a> counter-potent. See writers call it Vairy cuppy, Vairy tassy, and Meirr&eacute;, and there is every reason to believe that it is nothing but an accidental variety of Vair, q.v., with fanciful names given to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Potent counter potent, argent and sable, a bend gules--MANCHESTER, co. Stafford.</p>
<p class="blazon">Potent counter potent, gules and argent, a chevron or--AMOS or AMES.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a chevron potent counter potent or and gules between three ewers with handles of the second--BUREAU.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="476"></a><p class="blazon">3. The term <a href="../p/potent.html">Potent</a> is also applied to the edge of an ordinary or to a line of division, though the latter but rarely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a bend argent between four cotises potent or--SANXER.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a bend argent two cotises potent on the upper side or--CHAMPAGNE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a plain bend between two cotises potent on the outer edge sable, a tilting spear of the first--CARMICHAEL[afterwards COULTHART].</p>
<p class="blazon">Gules, a tower between three cinquefoils argent, within a bordure potent ermine--HAMILTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, a chief potent quarterly or and gules--PECKHAM.</p>
