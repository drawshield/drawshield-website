<p>Prester(or Presbyter) JOHN: this singular figure is represented as seated on a stone(described as a <a  href="../t/tombstone.html">tombstone</a>), and forms the insignia of the See of CHICHESTER, the only instance in which the bearing occurs. The origin of the figure is obscure. In 1180 the seal represented the Figure of Christ seated on a Tomb, with perhaps a symbolical reference to Rev. i. 16, and Rev. v. 1. Early in the next century the mythical story of Prester John, a supposed King of central Asia, was current, a certain Franciscan monk, by name Carpini, who went out as a Missionary in 1206, having brought home or invented the story, and this being very popular was afterwards, perhaps, applied to the <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a>.</p>
