<h1>Quadrature</h1>
<p>Quadrature: four charges placed in a square have been described as in quadrature, or in quadrangle, instead of <a  href="../t/two-and-two.html">two and two</a>, which is more correct; but this is seldom necessary, as four charges would naturally so be placed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a circular wreath plaited argent and sable with four hawk's bills or, appended thereto in quadrature--JOCELYN.</p>
</blockquote>
