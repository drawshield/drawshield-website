<p>Quatrefoil, (fr. quartefeuille): a charge the design of which may have been derived from some four-leaved flower, but more probably produced in the course of the ordinary workman's craft. It should be drawn pierced, unless described as <a  href="../b/blind.html">blind</a>; and when <a href="../q/quatrefoil.html">quatrefoils</a> are slipped, the stalk should join the lower leaf. It is sometimes spelt caterfoil.</p>
<p class="blazon">Though quintefoils are common is the ancient rolls, quatrefoils have not been observed. A Double quatrefoils is simply a Huitfoil. See <a  href="../f/foil.html">Foil</a>.</p>
