<h1>Rake</h1>
<p>Rake, (fr. rateau): is drawn in the usual form of that used by haymakers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, two rakes(?) in pale argent--BROMLE.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a bend sable three rakes of the first--BRAMBERT.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure class="parker-illustration float-md-right"><img src="../img/488a.png" alt="Thatcher's Rake." border="0"><figcaption class="parker-caption">Thatcher's Rake.</figcaption></figure>

<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../t/thatch-rake.html">thatch-rake</a> or thatcher's <a href="../r/rake.html">rake</a> is drawn as in the margin; but it is liable to be confused with the <a  href="../w/wool-comb.html">wool-comb</a> and thatch-hook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three thatcher's rakes barwise sable--ZAKESLEY.</p>
</blockquote>
