<h1>Raven</h1>
<p>Raven, (fr. corbeau): probably in heraldic drawing no difference would be detected in the drawing of the raven, the rook, or the crow; and perhaps even the old names Corbie, corby-crow, corbyn, corf, and the other variations of the Latin corvus were not marked by any nice distinction. As will be seen, the bearing occurs on several ancient arms for the sake of the play upon the name. It may be <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a  href="../c/croaking.html">croaking</a>. It will be seen the daw also as well as the <a href="../r/rook.html">rook</a> is adopted for the same reason.</p>
