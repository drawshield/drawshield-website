<p>Regalia: a name given to the <a  href="../c/crown.html">crown</a>, <a  href="../o/orb.html">orb</a>, <a  href="../s/sceptre.html">sceptre</a>, &amp;c. The <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a> of <a  href="../e/earl.html">Earl</a> MANDEVILLE'S arms, however, is perhaps erroneous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Per pale or and gules; the regalia sable--MANDEVILLE, Earl of Essex, [according to Burke].</p>
