<h1>Reptiles</h1>
<p>Reptiles: the reptiles are scarcely represented at all in ancient rolls of arms. Even the serpents are only referred to under the <a  href="../b/bisse.html">Bisse's</a> <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a>(see under <a  href="../s/serpent.html">Serpent</a>). But in later times it will be found that serpents and snakes are not uncommon, as well as <a  href="../a/adders.html">adders</a>, <a  href="../a/asp.html">asps</a>, and <a  href="../v/viper.html">vipers</a>. As will be seen by the Synoptical Table, frogs and toads, effets and newts, and lizards, and the cameleon are found, but they are rare. While of the tortoise, alligator, and crocodile only solitary instances have been observed.</p>
