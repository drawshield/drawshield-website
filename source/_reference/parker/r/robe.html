<p>Robe: this is seldom borne singly. A <a  href="../k/king.html">king</a> is found in his <a href="../r/robe.html">robes</a>; the Merchant Taylors bear two Parliament Robes, which are faced with <a  href="../e/ermine.html">ermine</a>. This is sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as a <a  href="../m/mantle.html">mantle</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon">Argent, a royal tent between two parliament robes gules lined ermine, the tent garnished or, tent staff and pennon of the last, on a chief azure a lion passant gardant or--Company of MERCHANT TAYLORS[Inc. 1466].</p>
