<h1>Royal Exchange</h1>
<p>Royal Exchange: this is given as an example of the extent to which a departure from the simplicity of ancient heraldry has been carried.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, on a mount vert the Royal Exchange proper adorned and embellished or, in chief two ships, the dexter under sail, hulk of the last, mast, sail and rigging as the third, the sinister slip riding at anchor sails furled blazoned like the dexter all proper--ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE COMPANY.</p>
