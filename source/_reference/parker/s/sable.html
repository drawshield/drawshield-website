<h1>Sable</h1>
<p>Sable, (fr. sable): the heraldic term for <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a>, the term being probably derived from certain animals with <a  href="../b/black.html">black</a> feet called Sabellin&oelig;(mustela zibellina of Linn&aelig;us). It is called <a href="../s/saturn.html">Saturn</a> by those who fancifully blazon by the planets, and Diamond by those who use the names of jewels. Engravers represent it by numerous perpendicular and horizontal lines crossing each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Arms simply sable are found to have been borne by the following families:--GOURNEY(a Norfolk family); DOMBALE; GLEGG; and LORRAINE.</p>
</blockquote>
