<h1>Saints</h1>
<p>Saints: the figures of Saints and martyrs are scarcely suitable for heraldic bearings: still in the later middle ages, in connection with certain northern Sees and Burghs, Saints are introduced, though perhaps rather as seal-devices than as true coats of arms. A figure of S.Andrew appears as in the Insignia of S.ANDREW'S: of S.Boniface in those of the See of ROSS: of S.Bryce on the seal of the Burgh of KIRKALDIE: of S.Edmund in the Insignia of the Bishopric of the ISLES: S.Giles in those of the See of MORAY; S.Magnus in those of the See of ORKNEY: S.Margaret of Scotland in those of the Burgh of QUEENSFERRY: S.Michael in those of the See of ABERDEEN, as well as of the Burghs of LINLITHGOW and of DUNDEE: and S.Ninian in those of the See of GALLOWAY.</p>
<p class="blazon">In the <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazon</a> of the Insignia of the Irish Bishoprick of CASHEL, EMLY, &amp;c., simply a Saint is mentioned, but no name; the same also occurs in those of the Burgh of BRECHIN.</p>
<a id="512"></a><p class="blazon">It will be seen that the figures of Saints are variously placed and habited; moreover, the blazon varies considerably, each writer adopting his own method of description, for practically they are without the <a  href="../p/pale.html">pale</a> of <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> <a  href="../h/heraldry.html">heraldry</a>.</p>
<p class="blazon">The list here given might be, perhaps, somewhat enlarged, but it is sufficient to shew the way in which <a href="../s/saints.html">Saints</a> are introduced. See also the example of S.Nicholas under <a  href="../b/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, (generally, but erroneously, blazoned as S.Michael), the Blessed Virgin Mary, &amp;c. Besides these the emblems are often mentioned, e.g. the <a  href="../c/cross.html">Cross</a> of S.George, the Cross of Standard of S.Andrew(i.e. the <a href="../s/saltire.html">saltire</a>), the knives of S.Bartholomew, the wheel of S.Katherine, the scourges of S.Guthlac, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
