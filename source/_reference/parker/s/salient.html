<h1>Salient</h1>
<p>Salient, (fr. saillant): usually applied to a wild beast when borne as if leaping at his prey. Sometimes also to a <a  href="../g/goat.html">goat</a>, (q.v.), instead of <a  href="../c/clymant.html">clymant</a>, and to a <a  href="../d/dog.html">dog</a>, <a  href="../c/cat.html">cat</a>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../s/salient.html">Salient</a> appears to have been originally only an accidental variation from rampant, but custom has sanctioned this term being used, in contradiction to the other, where both the <a  href="../h/hind.html">hind</a> <a  href="../p/paw.html">paws</a> are resting on the ground, and both the fore-paws are drawn as if level with each other.</p>
<p class="blazon">Counter-salient is used to signify leaping in contrary direction, that facing the sinister usually being uppermost. See <a  href="../r/rampant.html">Rampant</a> under <a  href="../l/lion.html">LION</a>.</p>
