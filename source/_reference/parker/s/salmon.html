<h1>Salmon</h1>
<p>Salmon, (fr. saumon): this fish is frequently blazoned in heraldry, though no very definite drawing has been noted. It is very frequently used for the sake of the play upon the name; sometimes by <a  href="../t/town.html">towns</a>, perhaps, such as Kingston-on-Thames, Peebles on the Tweed, Lanark on the Clyde, in consequence of salmon being plentiful near them; and by families in consequence of the fish thriving on their estates. Mr.Moule, in his work on the heraldry of fish, has collected many stories accounting for the device. That on the insignia of the town of Glasgow is supposed to be in allusion to a remark of S.Kentigern the first bishop.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">With the <a href="../s/salmon.html">salmon</a> is allied the Trout(fr. truite), and there is practically no difference in the drawing. Mr.Moule thinks when a <a  href="../f/fish.html">fish</a> is shewn in, or near, a river, and not distinctly named, it is intended for the trout, but does not give conclusive reasons. The French employ the trout, and frequently apply to it the term <a  href="../m/marquete.html">marquet&eacute;</a>, i.e. in reference to the spots.</p>

<a id="515"></a><p class="blazon">There are one or two other fish which should be here noted, such as the <a href="../s/smelts.html">smelt</a>(fr. eperlan), known in Scotland as the <a href="../s/sparling.html">sparling</a>. The 'grayling' is perhaps intended in the crest of the family of GRAYLEY; while the French name for the same, ombre, may have suggested the fish in the arms of the UMBRELL family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a chevron between three smelts naiant argent--SMELT, co. York.</p>
<p class="blazon">Erminois, three sparlings hauriant two and one proper--SPARLING, Petton, co. Salop.</p>
