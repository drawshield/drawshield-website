<p>Sanguine, or Murrey: blood colour, fancifully called by heraldic writers in the arms of princes Dragon's <a  href="../t/tail.html">tail</a>, and in those of lords Sardonyx. It is a tincture of very unfrequent occurrence, and not recognised at all by most writers. In engraving it is denoted by numerous lines in saltire.</p>
