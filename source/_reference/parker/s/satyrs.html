<h1>Satyrs</h1>
<p>Satyrs: amongst monsters the human figure came in for its share in combination with the lower animals. The <a href="../s/satyrs.html">Satyrs</a> and Satyrals are not found in arms except as <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a>(e.g. to the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Lord STAWELL), bet satyrs' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a>, q.v., occur in one coat of arms. The <a  href="../m/man-tiger.html">Mantiger</a> or Lampago, called by writers Montegre and Manticora, also occurs, e.g. the body of an heraldic tiger, with the <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a> of an old man with <a  href="../l/long.html">long</a> spiral horns. The <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a>, however, to the arms of the Earl of HUNTINGDON are without <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a>. The <a  href="../t/triton.html">Triton</a>, or mer-man, occurs as a <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporter</a>, e.g. to the <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of Lord LYTTELTON, and in more than one instance as a <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a>, e.g. of Sir Tatton SYKES and of the family of LANG in Leicestershire and Suffolk. The <a  href="../n/neptune.html">Neptune</a>, q.v., in the arms of Sir Isaac HEARD, Garter King of Arms 1750, is sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as a <a  href="../t/triton.html">Triton</a>. The <a href="../s/supporters.html">supporters</a> to the Insignia of 'The ACADEMY OF THE MUSES,' London, were 'dexter, a Satyr; <a href="../s/sinister.html">sinister</a>, a Mer-man.'</p>
