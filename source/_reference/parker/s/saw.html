<p>Saw: this device is rare; an example of a framed saw has already been noted as borne by the company of FANMAKERS. (See <a  href="../f/fan.html">Fan</a>.) One also occurs in the crest of HAMILTON. A <a  href="../h/hand-saw.html">handsaw</a> is blazoned on one coat of arms, and a crooked saw is sometimes so blazoned on another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Out of a ducal coronet an oak-tree fructed proper, cut through the main stem by a framesaw proper, the frame or--Crest of HAMILTON, Duke of Hamilton and Brandon.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron engrailed gules between in chief two escallops of the last, and in base a handsaw palewise azure handle or--SAWERS, Scotland.</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, within a double tressure flory counterflory with fleur-de-lis sable a lion rampant of the second, holding in his dexter paw a crooked saw proper[otherwise a sabre]--MAC CAUSLAND, Strabane, Ireland.</p>
