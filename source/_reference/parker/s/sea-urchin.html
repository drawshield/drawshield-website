<p>Sea-urchin: the figure representing the commonest existing species of the Echinid&aelig; on our own sea-shore seems to have found a place amongst heraldic devices, though when <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> from had drawing the figure may often be described as a <a  href="../h/hedgehog.html">Hedgehog</a>, (q.v.), or even a Porcupine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three sea-urchins erect argent[Otherwise Gules, three sea-urchins in pale argent]--ALSTANTON.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three urchins passant in pale or--WOOD.</p>
