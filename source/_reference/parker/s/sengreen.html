<p>Sengreen is a name for the plant called <a  href="../h/house-leak.html">house-leak</a>(the saxifraga nivalis of Linn&aelig;us): it occurs only in the very extraordinary <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of one of the founders of a college in Cambridge. The illustration here given is from the college book-plate, with the <a  href="../w/word.html">words</a> of the grant as printed by Gibbon.</p>

<p class="blazon">"Gold semied with flowers gentil, a sengreen in chief over the heads of two whole serpents in pale, their tails knit together(all in proper colour) resting upon a square marble-stone vert, between these a book sable garnisht gules buckled gold"--Dr.John KAYE[co-founder with GONVILLE of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, temp. Queen Mary].</p>
