<p>Serpent: the serpent or snake, for they are in heraldry absolutely synonymous, (fr. serpent), is found in the ancient rolls under the name of bis; the <a  href="../w/word.html">word</a> survives in the Italian biscia, or cobra of Milan. The <a  href="../r/reptiles.html">reptile</a> occurs rather frequently in coats of arms, and its position should be described. As seen in the case of the arms of CAIUS above, it may be represented <a  href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>. It may also be drawn gliding or fessways.</p>
<p class="blazon">It may be <a  href="../i/involved.html">involved</a> or encircled(both terms meaning the same), as shewn in the margin, in which position it occurs in the arms of WHITBY Abbey. The <a  href="../d/device.html">device</a> was probably suggested by the fossil Ammonites, found in the lias clay there, and which were at first supposed to be petrified snakes. When <a  href="../i/involved.html">involved</a>, the French heralds seem to use the word guivre for snake.</p>

<a id="530"></a><p class="blazon"><a href="../s/snake.html">Snakes</a> are also represented <a  href="../n/nowed.html">nowed</a>, (q.v.), or twisted in a knot. In the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> of CAVENDISH the reptile is represented as in the margin, and theoretical heralds contend that if represented as in the lowest of the two figures it would be <a  href="../n/nowed.html">nowed</a> <a  href="../r/reversed.html">reversed</a>. Also, as will be seen, there are complications of the nowed position.</p>
<p class="blazon">One or two other varieties are given, but heraldic writers such as Holme devote several pages to imaginary positions of serpents, and fanciful terms to fit them, none of which, however, are found to occur in any coats of arms. They are sometimes represented with <a  href="../t/tail.html">tails</a> in their mouths; at others round a pillar, or round necks of children. (See <a  href="../a/arms.html">arms</a> of VAUGHAN under <a  href="../e/enveloped.html">Enveloped</a>.)</p>
<p class="blazon">See also <a  href="../a/adders.html">Adder</a>, from which there is little or nothing to distinguish the charge in heraldic drawing.</p>
