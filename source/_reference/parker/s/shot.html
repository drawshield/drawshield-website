<p>Shot: there are one or two names given to the kinds of <a href="../s/shot.html">shot</a> used. The <a href="../s/star.html">star</a> <a href="../s/stones.html">stone</a>, as it is sometimes called from its appearance, is figured in the margin. Possibly the chain shot is synonymous--called by Guillim 'a murdering chain shot.' (See also <a  href="../f/fire-ball.html">Fireball</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Gules, on a chevron argent a rose between two lions counterpassant of the first, in base a star stone proper--George HEPBURN.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three chain shots or[quartered by CLIFFORD, Earl of Cumberland].</p>
<p class="blazon">Or, two chain shots, one in chief and the other in base sable--SOMBR&eacute;.</p>

<p class="blazon">An <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> form of <a href="../s/shot.html">shot</a> is represented in the margin, where the two ends are united by a bar instead of by a chain. The <a  href="../g/gun-stone.html">gun stones</a>, though no doubt called so from their use as projectiles from guns, are considered as one of the roundles. (See <a  href="../p/pellet.html">Pellets</a>.)</p>
