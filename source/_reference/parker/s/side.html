<p>Side: a portion of the shield, not more than one sixth of its breadth, cut off by a perpendicular line. Theoretically it may be <a  href="../d/dexter.html">dexter</a> or sinister; but it seems not no be adopted by any English family, though it appears in the arms of a German family resident here. In one MS., too, a quartering bearing a side is introduced into the arms of Bp. Edward FOX.</p>
