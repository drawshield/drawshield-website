<p>Sphere, (fr. sph&eacute;re): the Terrestrial Sphere, or Globe, is rare in arms but not uncommon as part of a crest, e.g. of families of HOPE, DRAKE, &amp;c. It is often environed with a meridian, and sometimes placed in a frame or stand. A remarkable example of late heraldic invention, and one of the worst, is seen in the arms of Sir John ROSS.</p>
<p class="blazon">Similar to the sphere, but plain and(as a rule) surmounted by a cross, is the mound or Orb, q.v.</p>
