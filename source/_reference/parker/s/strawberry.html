<h1>Strawberry</h1>
<p>Strawberry: the leaf only is the part usually borne, though in one case sprigs fructed occur. The more frequent term for the strawberry-leaf is the frasier, which is a Scotch term for a <a  href="../c/cinquefoil.html">cinquefoil</a>; hence some contend that this charge should be represented merely as such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, on a bend between in chief a greyhound courant bendwise and in base a dolphin haurient argent, three torteaux; a chief of the second charged with three sprigs of strawberry fructed proper--HOLLIST, Midhurst, Sussex.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three garbs or with a strawberry leaf in the centre--CUMING, Moray, temp. James V.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, three frasiers argent--FRASER, Pitcallain.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a lion rampant argent crowned with an antique crown or armed and langued gules within a bordure of the second charged with six frasiers of the first--MAC DOUGALL, Mackerston, co. Roxburgh.</p>
