<h1>Sunflower</h1>
<p>Sunflower, (fr. soleil): this appears only in one English coat of arms, and in this case the family is of foreign extraction. It is blazoned <a  href="../h/heliotrope.html">heliotrope</a>, just as the French tournesol is sometimes used for the <a href="../s/sunflower.html">sunflower</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a heliotrope(or sunflower) or issuing from the stalk sprouting out of two leaves vert; in chief the sun in splendour proper--FLORIO[originally of Spain; granted 1614].</p>
<p class="blazon">D'argent, au tournesol d'or tig&eacute; feuill&eacute; et terrass&eacute; de sinople--GUILLOIS, Ile de France.</p>
</blockquote>
