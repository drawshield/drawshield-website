<h1>Swan</h1>
<p>Swan, (lat. cygnus, fr. cygne): this graceful bird has for various reasons been a favourite charge in armorial bearings. Swans are generally <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a>, i.e. <a  href="../w/white.html">white</a>, else they are described as <a  href="../a/argent.html">argent</a>, but they are frequently beaked and legged of other tinctures. The <a  href="../b/birds.html">bird</a> is generally borne with <a  href="../e/expanded.html">expanded</a> <a  href="../w/wings.html">wings</a>, and it seems desirable that the position should be noticed, though as a fact it is only seldom so. Sometimes they are drawn swimming towards each other, and for this the word 'respectant' or 'incontrant' seems to have been used by some heraldic writers.</p>
