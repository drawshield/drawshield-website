<h1>Tail</h1>
<p>Tail, (fr. queue, old fr. couwe, cowe, and other spellings), is referred to very frequently in the blazon, and several examples have already been given under <a  href="../l/lion.html">Lion</a>. It will have been observed that in the old rolls of arms the lion is very frequently represented with the <a href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> <a  href="../f/fork.html">forked</a>(od la couwe fourch&eacute;e), or, as is sometimes, but erroneously, blazoned double queued. Also that the tail may sometimes be <a  href="../n/nowed.html">nowed</a>(for which the old French crois&eacute; and the modern French pass&eacute;e en sautoir seem to be equivalent); double nowed, and even forked and nowed(fourch&eacute;e et renou&eacute;e) occur, but such are rare, The <a href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> may be <a  href="../e/erect.html">erect</a>(for which the fr. term <a  href="../e/estroict.html">estroict</a> is found) or extended, the latter only in the case of the lion passant, meaning that the tail is stretched out horizontally. Tails, it will be seen, are blazoned as <a  href="../i/inverted.html">inverted</a>, introverted, and turned over the head; also <a  href="../c/coward.html">coward</a>, when the <a href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> hangs down between the hind legs. The end of the tail is called the <a  href="../b/brush.html">brush</a> or tuft.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">The same varieties are found in the tails of other animals than Lions, but not so frequently, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Sable, a bull statant argent, the tail between his legs[i.e. coward]--FITZ-GEFFREY, co. Bedford.</p>
<p class="blazon">Ermine, a griffin segreant coward gules, beaked and legged azure--GRANTHAM, co. Lincoln.</p>
<p class="blazon">Argent, two bars sable, on the upper one a wivern volant, tail extended of the field--MANFELD.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="568"></a><p class="blazon">The <a href="../t/tail.html">tail</a> is also sometimes borne separately from the animal, and when so, is generally <a  href="../e/erased.html">erased</a> at the lower extremity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Different names have been fancifully given by some heralds to the <a href="../t/tail.html">tails</a> of different animals, such as the single, the wreath, the scut, &amp;c., but no instances have been observed of their use.</p>
