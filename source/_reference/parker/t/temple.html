<h1>Temple</h1>
<p>Temple: examples of this device occur rarely, e.g. in the See of ABERDEEN, where the church is blazoned as a <a href="../t/temple.html">temple</a>(see under <a  href="../b/bishop.html">Bishop</a>). The <a  href="../a/antique.html">antique</a> <a href="../t/temple.html">temple</a> occurs, but as <a  href="../s/steeple.html">steeples</a> are named, it is probable the charge is meant for an ancient church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, on a mount in base vert an antique temple of three stories, each embattled; from the second battlement two steeples, and from the top, one, each ending in a cross sable--TEMPLAR, [granted 1765].</p>
<p class="blazon">Quarterly azure and gules, the perspective of an antique temple argent, on the pinnacle and exterior battlements a cross or; in the first quarter an eagle displayed; in the second a stag trippant regardant of the last--TEMPLER, co. Devon.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a temple or--TEMPLE, Scotland.</p>
