<h1>Tenn&eacute;</h1>
<p>Tenn&eacute;, Tawney, Orange, or Brusk: Orange colour. In engravings it should be represented by lines in bend sinister crossed by others barways. Heralds who blazon by the names of the heavenly bodies call it Dragon's <a  href="../h/head.html">head</a>, and those who employ jewels, Hyacinth, or Jacynth. It is very rarely found mentioned, but was one of the colours forming the livery of the royal House of Stuart. Further, it is one of the colours which when applied to <a  href="../a/abatements.html">abatements</a> is called in heraldic treatises stainand.</p>
