<h1>Tent</h1>
<p>Tent, (fr. tente): this is represented as in the margin. It often has a pennon attached, which should be named. A <a href="../t/tent.html">tent</a> royal should be made more ornamental than the figure, and should have a split pennon flowing towards the sinister. [See example of MERCHANT TAYLORS, given under <a  href="../r/robe.html">Robe</a>.]</p>
<p class="blazon">The terms <a  href="../p/pavillion.html">Pavilion</a> and Tabernacle generally imply a tent like the above, while in the grant of arms to the UPHOLDERS' COMPANY the tents are termed <a  href="../s/sperver.html">spervers</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, a chevron between three royal tents sable--TINTEN, St.Fudy, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="blazon">Azure, a chevron between three tents argent--MAYBANK.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three pavilions argent, lined ermine--Company of UPHOLDERS' Chester.</p>
<p class="blazon">Sable, three pavilions[or spervers] ermine, lined azure, garnished or; within the pavilion in base a lamb couchant argent, on a cushion or tasselled of the last; over the head a cross fitchy gules, [Elsewhere blazoned Sable, on a chevron or, between three tents without poles, ermine, lined azure(another, 1730, gules); as many roses gules]--Company of UPHOLDERS, granted 1465.</p>

<a id="570"></a><p class="blazon">In French arms a Pavilion, or tent, was sometimes adopted fur surrounding the shield-especially the Royal shield-instead of the <a  href="../l/lambrequin.html">Lambrequin</a> or Mantle. For one form also the term <a  href="../c/cappeline.html">Capeline</a> seems to be used.</p>
