<h1>Tiger</h1>
<p>Tiger: thus beast, as drawn by ancient painters, is now often called the heraldic tiger, as distinguished from the natural. Such distinctions of course are not real, since the old heralds drew the tiger as they did many animals, conventionally. The heraldic form of the <a href="../t/tiger.html">tiger</a> is shewn in the margin. The <a href="../t/tiger.html">tiger</a> looking into a mirror(q.v.) is a very remarkable bearing. Amongst other extraordinary ideas which our ancestors entertained respecting strange animals was this-that in order to rob the tigress of her young, it was only necessary to lay mirrors in her way, in which she would stop to look at her own image, and thereby give the robbers time to escape. Tigers' <a  href="../h/head.html">heads</a> and faces also occur.</p>
