<h1>Tressure</h1>
<p>Tressure, (old fr. tressour, fr. trecheur): a subordinary, considered by some as a <a  href="../d/diminutive.html">diminutive</a> of the <a  href="../o/orle.html">orle</a>. It may be single or double(and some say even triple), but is mostly borne double, and fleury-counterfleury, as in the royal arms of Scotland, q.v., whence the charge is sometimes called 'the royal tressure.' When impaled, it is said to follow the rule of the bordure, and not to be continued on the side of the impalement, but several exceptions may be found. When an <a  href="../o/ordinaries.html">ordinary</a> is described as within a tressure it should extend only to the inner side of the tressure.</p>
