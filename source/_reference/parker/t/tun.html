<h1>Tun</h1>
<p>Tun, (fr. tonneau, but if small, barillet): a large barrel, represented usually as in the margin, that is lving length ways. They are sometimes represented with the hoops of another tincture. It occurs in the insignia of the BREWERS' and VINTNERS' Companies, as well as in the arms of a few families. Sometimes the term <a  href="../h/hogsheads.html">hogshead</a>, or <a  href="../b/barrel.html">barrel</a>, or even tub, is used, and perhaps in that case the charge should be drawn upright. It was very commonly used in the Rebus, q.v., so many names ending in ton. [See example of the lion hopping on a tun for name of Hopton under <a  href="../l/lion.html">Lion</a>.]</p>
