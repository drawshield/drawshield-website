<p>Vert, (fr. sinople): green; absurdly called <a href="../v/venus.html">Venus</a> by those who adopt planets, and Emerald by those who adopt the name precious stones instead of the true name of the <a  href="../t/tincture.html">tincture</a>. It is expressed in engravings by line in bend. The French are said to have called it Sinople, from a town in the Levant(probably Sinope in Asia Minor) from which were brought the best materials for dyeing green, or silks and stuffs of a brilliant green colour, but the term does not occur before the fifteenth century. In the <a  href="../a/ancient.html">ancient</a> <a  href="../r/rolls.html">rolls</a> <a href="../v/vert.html">vert</a> seems to be used occasionally(e.g. in the Roll of Carlaverock spelt verde). The term <a  href="../p/prasin.html">prasin</a> has also been fancifully used, from the Greek <img src="../img/greek02.png" alt="prason" class="align-center">, a leek.</p>
