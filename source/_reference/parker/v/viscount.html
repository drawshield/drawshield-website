<h1>Viscount</h1>
<p>Viscount: the fourth order of the peerage of England, being the intermediate rank between earl and baron. The title was originally the official name of the deputy of an earl, whence the name vice-comes, then Shire-reeve or Sheriff of a county. It was afterwards granted as a title of honour of John, Lord Beaumont, to whom King Henry VI., 1440, gave by patent the title of Viscount Beaumont in England and France, and hence the distinguishing affix, 'The Lord Viscount'</p>
