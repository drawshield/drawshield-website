<h1>Viure</h1>
<p>Viure, or Wiure, or Wyer. This term, variously spelt, is said by heraldic writers to signify a very narrow fillet or riband, generally <a  href="../n/nebuly.html">nebuly</a>(though no case of nebuly is cited, nor has one been found) which may be placed in bend, in fesse, or otherwise. It is probably only the common English word 'wire,' which some heraldic writer has written according to old spelling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="blazon">Argent, three bars gemels azure, on a chief gules a viure or--HAYDON, co. Devon.</p>
