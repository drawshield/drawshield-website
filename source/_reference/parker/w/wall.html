<h1>Wall</h1>
<p>Wall, (sometimes called a <a  href="../d/dyke.html">dyke</a>, fr. mur): this is generally found named in connection with <a  href="../c/castle.html">castles</a> or towns which are walled(muraill&eacute;). A <a href="../w/wall.html">wall</a> of this kind should be <a  href="../m/masoned.html">masoned</a>(fr. ma&ccedil;onn&eacute;) and embattled(fr. crenell&eacute;), even though this be not specified.</p>
