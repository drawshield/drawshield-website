<h1>Water</h1>
<p>Water: this occurs indirectly in many ways. It is conventionally represented by <a  href="../b/barry.html">barry</a> <a href="../w/wavy.html">wavy</a> <a  href="../a/argent.html">argent</a> and azure, and thus the roundle so tinctured is technically called a <a  href="../f/fountain.html">fountain</a>, and is supposed to represent the water lying at the bottom of the well or spring.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a  href="../b/base.html">base</a> of the <a  href="../s/shield.html">shield</a> is often made to represent the ocean(q.v.), and sometimes with <a  href="../s/ship.html">ships</a> <a  href="../s/sail.html">sailing</a> upon it. A <a  href="../r/river.html">river</a>(fr. rivi&egrave;re) also is often introduced into coats of arms, and this especially in connection with <a  href="../b/bridge.html">bridges</a>. An example of a ford will be found noticed under <a  href="../b/bull.html">Bull</a>, <a  href="../c/camel.html">Camel</a> &amp;c., and possibly a pond is intended in the example given below, as borne by OHENLOYNE, though the tincture being vert it is doubtful. The <a  href="../l/loch.html">loch</a> is mentioned in one or two coats of arms(see those of LITHGOW under <a  href="../o/otter.html">Otter</a>). The singular device of Water-bubbles is also <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> and figured in one Heraldic work as belonging to the name of BUBBLEWARD, but it is a question whether it occurs in actual Heraldry, or whether it is in invention of some fanciful writer.</p>
