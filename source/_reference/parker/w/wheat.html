<h1>Wheat</h1>
<p>Wheat, (fr. bl&eacute;): this was represented in the older arms in sheaves only, to which the name Garb was given; and under this term <a href="../w/wheat.html">wheat</a> continued to be most frequently represented. Some early examples have been given under Garb, q.v. In later examples it will be seen they are often bended of another tincture. When the term <a  href="../p/proper.html">proper</a> is used it probably signifies or.</p>

<p class="blazon">In later arms ears of wheat or corn have been adopted as <a  href="../d/device.html">devices</a>(and may be represented as in the margin), and of other grains, such as <a  href="../b/barley.html">barley</a>, <a  href="../o/oats.html">oats</a>, and <a  href="../r/rye.html">rye</a>. When <a  href="../b/bearded.html">bearded</a> they are said to be aulned. To the stalk and eat thus borne the French give the name <a  href="../e/epis.html">epis</a>, and when the stalk is of a different tincture it is tig&eacute; of such tincture.</p>
<p class="blazon">The <a href="../w/wheat.html">wheat</a> in the arms of the family of GRAUNDORGE(whose name is spelt in a variety of ways) is found <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> guinea-wheat, but no doubt from the name[i.e. grain d'orge] barley grain is intended. It may be that from a play on the name(grand) the term big-wheat arose, a term adopted in blazoning the arms of BIGLAND and BIGNELL, but White Kennett notes big as a kind of <a  href="../b/barley.html">barley</a>.</p>

<p class="blazon"><a  href="../b/barley.html">Barley</a> is specified in some cases as in the insignia of the BREWERS of London and Exeter; the garbs are sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a> as <a  href="../b/barley.html">barley</a> garbs, but they are not distinguishable from others.

<a id="619"></a><p class="blazon">The <a  href="../r/rye.html">rye</a> is distinguished from other grain by representing the ear drooping, as shewn in the margin. It is used by one or two families on account of the play upon the name.</p>
