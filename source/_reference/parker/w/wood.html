<h1>Wood</h1>
<p>Wood, (fr. for&ecirc;t); a small group of trees(generally on a mount) is found named in heraldry under various terms, e.g. a <a href="../w/wood.html">wood</a>, a <a  href="../g/grove.html">grove</a>(see <a  href="../g/grove.html">grove</a> of firs under Pine), or a thicket, and in one case a forest. The term 'hurst,' too, means the same thing, and perhaps bowers in the arms of GILLAM.</p>
