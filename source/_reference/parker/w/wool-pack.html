<p>Wool-pack, or as it is sometimes <a  href="../b/blazon.html">blazoned</a>, Wool-sack, is borne by one or two companies(e.g. that the BONNET MAKERS, Edinburgh, see under <a  href="../b/bonnet.html">Bonnet</a>). It is also borne by individuals, possibly from their having made their fortune in the wool trade. (See <a  href="../c/cushion.html">Cushion</a>.)</p>
