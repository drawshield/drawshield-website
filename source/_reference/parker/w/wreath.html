<h1>Wreath</h1>
<p>Wreath, (fr. tortil, also bourrelet): the wreath, technically speaking, is the twisted band composed of two strips of gold or silver lace and silk by which the <a  href="../c/crest.html">crest</a> is joined to the helmet; though some wreaths of the fifteenth century were of four tinctures. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a <a  href="../r/roll.html">roll</a>, at others a torse. It was, perhaps, copied by the crusaders from the wreathed turbans of the Saracens. The first noticed is that of Sir John de Harsich, 1384.</p>
<p class="blazon"><a href="../w/wreath.html">Wreaths</a> should always shew an equal number of divisions(now restricted to six), which are usually tinctured with the principal metal and colour of the arms alternately. Every Crest is understood to be placed upon a wreath, unless a chapeau or some coronet be expressly mentioned. But wreaths also sometimes occur as <a  href="../c/charge.html">charges</a>; e.g. we find a circular wreath. This is meant for the same object as the above, but viewed from a different point. Animals also are sometimes represented with <a href="../w/wreath.html">wreaths</a> on their heads.</p>
<p class="blazon">See also Hatband, as borne by BURY; and under <a  href="../h/harrow.html">Harrow</a> a circular wreath will be found <a  href="../f/figured.html">figured</a> in the arms.</p>
