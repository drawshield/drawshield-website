<p class="blazon">The late Mr.J. G. Nichols, in "Inventories of the Wardrobe, &amp;c., of Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond" (in the Camden Miscellany, vol. iii.), says(at p. lxxxviii.), "I am not aware that this animal is elsewhere known either in natural or heraldic zoology .... It differs from the heraldic antelope in having <a  href="../h/horn.html">horns</a> like those of a ram, and a tail like a <a  href="../d/dog.html">dog's</a>." The term <a href="../y/yale.html">yale</a> occurs in the College records.</p>
