<p class="content"><span class="entry">ANNAN </span>(County of Dumfries). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal shows an escutcheon charged with a saltire within a bordure. These arms are described in the catalogue of the Heraldic Exhibition in Edinburgh as . the arms of Annandale. The arms of Annand, Lord of Annandale, are quoted in Burke's " General Armory," " Ar. a saltire and a chief gu.," but the arms of Johnstone, Marquess of Annandale, a title dormant since 1792, and now claimed b}' Johnstone of Westerhall, are quoted, " ar. a saltire sa. on a chief gu. three cushions or." The seal shows no tinctures, so it appears to be doubtful what they actually are.</p>
