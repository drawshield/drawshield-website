<p class="content"><span class="entry">APPLEBY </span>(Westmorland). Has no armorial bearings. The seal of the corporation at present in use, copied from the obverse of the ancient seal, represents an apple-tree overspreading the field and surmounted by an escutcheon, thereon three lions passant guardant in pale, with the legend " Sigiliuni communitatis burgii de Appilbi," and a representation of this is all that is given in Debrett's</p>

"House of Commons." Burke's "General Armory" quotes " Az. three lions pass, guard, in pale or, ducally crowned of the last." But as they are supplied to me by the Town Clerk of the borough, and as they are used, the arms appear to be gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or, crowned with ducal coronets of the last. Crest — On a ducal coronet, a salamander in flames of fire all proper. Supporters — On either side, a dragon with wings inverted gules. Motto — " Nee ferro nee igni."

<p class="content"> Berry, who simply gives as arms, " azure three lions passant guardant in pale or, crowned with ducal coronets of the last," gives the following note : —</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" These arms are engraved on the corporation seal, round which is this legend, ' Sigillum communitatis burgii de Appilbi.' On the reverse is the figure of St Laurence laid on a gridiron, placed over a fire, and at each end thereof are figures not to be perfectly defined ; above them, near to the dexter side, is a banner with the arms of the borough, and below them three estoiles ; and near to the sinister is an angel, holding a cope to receive the soul of the saint. Round the reverse is this legend, ' Hie jacet Laurentius in craticula positus.' This identical seal was given to the burghers of Appleby by King John, whose original charter is still preserved in the town chest. The parochial church is dedicated to St Laurence, and a fair is annually kept within the borough on St Laurence's Day. .\ tradition prevails in the borough that the lions in the arms were crowned with ducal crowns in memory of some signal service performed by the burghers against the Scots."
