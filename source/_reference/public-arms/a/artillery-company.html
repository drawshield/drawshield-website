Argent, a cross gules (being that of St George) charged with a lion passant guardant or (being part of the Royal Arms of England), on a chief azure, a portcullis of the third between two ostrich feathers erect of the field. Crest— Qx\ a wreath of the colours, a dexter arm embowed in armour, the gauntlet grasping a pike in bend sinister or between two dragon's wings argent, each charged with a cross gules. Supporters — On the dexter side a pikeman armed and accoutred, supporting with the exterior hand a pike erect proper, and on the sinister side a musketeer, with his matchlock, bandolier, and rest all proper. Motto — " Arma pacis fulcra." [Recorded in the Heralds' College. Exemplified 1821. Whilst the foregoing is the official blazon of the supporters, the following description is perhaps a better guide to the artist. Siipporters — Dexter, a man proper, his head and body in armour, his arms habited in buff, breeches gules, stockings argent, shoes proper, holding in his exterior hand a pike. Sinister, a man proper habited as the dexter, except the armour on the body, this having a coat of buff proper over his left shoulder, and under his right arm a belt strung with cartouches gules, in his sinister hand a musket erect, a resting staff and match-rope, and at his side a scimitar, all proper. The Supporters are habited as in the time of King Charles I., the dexter as a regular soldier, the sinister as a militia-man of the city.]</p>
