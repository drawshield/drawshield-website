<p class="content"><span class="entry">ASHBURTON </span>(Devonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents upon a mount a chapel with a spire between a branch of teazle on the dexter side, and a saltire couped on the sinister side, in the dexter chief a sun in splendour, and in the sinister chief a crescent : with the legend " Sigillvm Bvrgi de Aysheberton." This has been quoted to the editor as a coat-ofarms, the following colours being assigned : — The field azure, the mount vert, the chapel, sun, crescent, and saltire argent, the teazle proper, with the motto,</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Fides probata coronat." The saltire is allusive of St Andrew, the patron saint of the Parish Church. The sun and moon are supposed to be old Phoenician symbols, and are therefore used to indicate the Stannary rights ; the teazle calls attention to the woollen industry, and the chapel represents that of St Lawrence, which was the Guild Chantry, built by Bishop Stapeldon, 1 3 14, and given to the Portreeve and Burgesses.
