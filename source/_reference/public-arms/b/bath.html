<p class="content"> [Recorded in the College of Arms.]</p>
<p class="content"> The arms are blazoned in Burke, however, as party per fesse embattled azure and gules, the base masoned sable and charged with two crosses bottonnee of the last as fortifications; in chief two bars wavy argent, over all a sword in pale of the last, hilt and pommel or, on the blade a key.</p>
<p class="content"> The Corporation have assumed and use as Supporters on the dexter side a lion and on the sinister a bear, but these are of absolutely no authority. Berry adds a note that in a manuscript in the British Museum, No. 1445, the arms of Bath are thus blazoned, viz., per fesse embattled gules and water proper, viz., the base water proper, the chief masoned sable, over all a sword in pale argent, hilt and pommel or. And the like arms are painted on the roof of the Abbey Church at Bath.</p>
