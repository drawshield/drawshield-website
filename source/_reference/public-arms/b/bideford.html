<p class="content"><span class="entry">BIDEFORD </span>(Devonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a bridge consisting of one arch and two demi-arches over a river. On the river is a single-masted vessel, one-half of which appears to have passed through the bridge, but with the mast and round top on the other side.</p>
