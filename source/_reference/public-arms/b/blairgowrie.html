<p class="content"><span class="entry">BLAIRGOWRIE </span>(Perthshire). Has no arms. The Burgh Seal was designed by Mr John A. R. Macdonald, C.E., architect of that town, who seems proud of it. It's about as appalling as any to be found amongst the Scottish Police Burgh Seals, which is saying a good deal. The shield is per fesse and the chief per pale. In the first division on a wreath is a garb, the crest of Blair of Blair, in the second on a wreath is a birds' nest, not forgetting the birds (stated to be young ravens and to represent the crest of Drummond of Blair). In base is a representation of "ye Brig o' Blair." To prevent any error it is so labelled underneath. Motto — " Bhlair gobhainn righ." [Quite bogus, of course.]</p>
