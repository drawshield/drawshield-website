<p class="content"><span class="entry">BRAZENOSE COLLEGE, </span>Oxford. (Founded 15 15 by William Smith, Bishop of Lincoln.) The escotcheon divided into three parts paleways the centre or, thereon an escotcheon charged with the Arms of the See of Lincoln, ensigned with a mitre, all proper, the dexter side argent, a chevron sable, between three roses gules, seeded or, barbed vert (being the Arms of the founder, William Smith), on the sinister side the Anns of Sir Richard Sutton, of Presbury, Chester, Knt., who finished the College, viz., quarterly : 1 and 4, argent, a chevron between three bugle-horns stringed sable (Sutton) ; 2 and 3, argent, a chevron between three crosses fiory sable (Samsbury).</p>
<p class="content"> [Recorded in the College of Arms at the Visitation of the County of Oxford, 1574. A visitation record of arms is in trick or colour, no verbal blazon being attached. The blazon above quoted is that usually adopted, but it is hardly correct to describe the escutcheon as divided into three parts, because the outer divisions are wider than the central one which latter is the width of a pale.]</p>
