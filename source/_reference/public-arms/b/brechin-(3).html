<p class="content"><span class="entry">BRECHIN, </span>Bishop of According to Crockford the arms in use are " Or, three piles in point gules." These arms were matriculated in Lyon Register in 1744 by Maule of Inverkeilour, and in 1867 by Knight-Erskine of Pittodrie, as part of their personal arms, as a quartering for the Lordship of Brechin to which the Arms properly appertain. Their use by the Bishop is most improper.</p>
