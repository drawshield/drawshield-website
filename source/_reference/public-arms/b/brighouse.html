<p class="content"><span class="entry">BRIGHOUSE </span>(Yorkshire). Or, on a pale sable, between in chief two roses gules, barbed and seeded proper, and in base two crescents of the second, a lion rampant of the field. And for the Crest — On a wreath of the colours, upon the battlements of a tower argent, charged with two crescents fessewise sable, a leopard's face of the first, between two roses gules, barbed, slipped and seeded proper. Motto — " Lahore et prudentia."</p>
