<p class="content"><span class="entry">BURNTISLAND </span>(Fifeshire). Has not matriculated any arms. The seal at present in use represents a three-masted ship with sails furled upon waves of the sea. The legend is " Sigillum burgi de Burntisland." This is sometimes quoted as a coat-of-arms, with the field azure and the ship argent. Another seal represents a fish within the legend " Success to the Herring Fishing."</p>
