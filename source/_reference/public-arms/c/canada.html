<p class="content"><span class="entry">CANADA, </span>Dominion of. Consequent upon the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1S67 a Royal Warrant was issued in 1869 (printed in F. E. Hulme's</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Flags of the World," p. 81), by which arms were assigned to the four provinces of Ontario, Quebec (previously called Upper Canada and Lower Canada respectively), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and authorising the four coats to be borne together quarterly for the Dominion as follows : —
</pre>
<p class="content"> Quarterly: i. For Ontario — Vert, a sprig of three leaves of maple slipped or, on a chief argent, the cross of St George.</p>
<p class="content"> 2. For Quebec — Or, on a fesse gules, between two fleurs-de-lis azure in chief, and a sprig of three leaves of maple vert in base, a lion passant guardant or.</p>
<p class="content"> 3. Vox Nova Scotia — Or, on a fesse wavy azure, between three thistles proper, a salmon naiant argent.</p>
<p class="content"> 4. For New Brunswick — Or, on waves, a lymphad with oars in action proper, on a chief gules, a lion passant guardant or.</p>
<p class="content"> Nothing official has since been done up to the present time to modify the force of the warrant or change its provisions, and the foregoing remains the legal and official coat of arms of the Dominion. In 1870 the Province of Manitoba was formed and admitted into the Union; British Columbia followed in 1871, and Prince Edward Island in 1S73, and since then Alberta and Saskatchewan. Legitimate Arms exist for all the foregoing (to which refer), and from time to time unofficial representations are to be found in which some or all are introduced into the arms of the Dominion as additional quarterings. This practice is at present unauthorised and improper. I understand, however, that at the moment of writing the question of the arms of the Dominion is under consideration, though whether the result will be one single and simple coat for the Dominion or the inclusion of additional quarterings remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="content"> No crest, supporters or motto were assigned to the Dominion in the original Royal Warrant, and though crests and supporters are on record for Ontario and for Nova Scotia, it would be quite incorrect to add them to the Dominion escutcheon.</p>
<p class="content"> The badge of a maple-leaf appears to be very generally accepted as a floral badge for Canada, but it has as yet no official recognition.</p>
<p class="content"> The quartered coat is borne in the flag of the Governor-General, the shield</p>
<p class="content"> being placed in a white disc in the centre of the flag within wreaths which are of maple-leaves instead of the oak-leaves prescribed for similar flags in other parts of the King's Dominions and ensigned by the Imperial crown.</p>
<p class="content"> The Lieutenant-Governors bear the arms of their respective provinces upon their flags within a similar wreath, but without the crown.</p>
<p class="content"> No arms have been officially assigned to the North-West Territories.</p>
