<p class="content"><span class="entry">CARLINGFORD </span>(Co. Louth). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. Those attributed to the Corporation in Lewis's " Topographical Dictionary " are decidedly unique. They represent a man armed cap-a-pie, brandishing in his dexter hand a sword, and between in chief an eagle rising from a demi-globe and in base a tower, on the dexter side are three birds, two ' and one, and on the sinister side a ship of three masts.</p>
