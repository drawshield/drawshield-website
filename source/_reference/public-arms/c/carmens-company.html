<p class="content"><span class="entry">CARMEN'S COMPANY </span>(London). (Made a Fellowship by Act of Common Council, 2ist June 1668.) Has no arms, but makes use of the supposed arms of the City of London.</p>
<p class="content"> The Carmen of London were anciently incorporated with the Fraternity of Fullers, under the name of Woodmongers, but for their malpractices they thought it convenient in 1668 to surrender their charter to avoid a greater punishment, and the Carmen were re-appointed a Fellowship. The Woodmongers Company [to which refer] used arms.</p>
