<p class="content"><span class="entry">CHESTER, </span>County Palatine of. Has no armorial bearings, but the following appear to be in general use, namely, azure, three garbs, two and one or (being the arms of the old Earls of Chester and the arms of the Earldom of Chester), within a garter, and surmounted by an earl's coronet. Supporters — Two dragons sejant addorsed gules {i.e. with their backs to the escutcheon), each holding in its exterior claw an ostrich feather argent affixed to a scroll. Motto — " Antiqui colant antiquum dierum." The garter, coronet, dragons, and ostrich feathers, of course, have palpable reference to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales being Earl of Chester. The arms of the Earldom of Chester appear upon the second great seal of Henry IV. ; and upon the seal of the County Council of Cheshire the same arms appear, though in this case flanked on either side by an ostrich feather and surmounted by an open coronet composed of crosses patt^e and fleurs-de-lis.</p>
