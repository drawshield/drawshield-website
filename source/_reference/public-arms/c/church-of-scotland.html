<p class="content"><span class="entry">CHURCH OF SCOTLAND. </span>Has no arms, but for centuries has used the device of a Burning Bush with the motto, " Nee tamen consumebatur." The device first appears on the title-page of " The Acts and Proceedings of the General Assembly of 1690," with the Motto, " Not consumed." It had, however, been adopted in 1 583 at the Twelfth National Synod of the French Reformed Church, when it was resolved that a seal be made, and on this seal was engraved the Burning Bush with the words, " Flagror non Consumor." The Irish Presbyterian Church uses the Motto, " Ardens sed Virens."</p>
