<p class="content"><span class="entry">COVENTRY </span>(Warwickshire). Party per pale gules and vert, an elephant statant and on his back a castle triple-towered and domed both or. Crest— A leopard (or is it a cat ?) statant guardant proper. Recorded in the College of Arms. A Motto is sometimes used — namely, " Camera Principis." For some reason this coat seems always to be drawn, and frequently to be quoted, with the elephant standing on a mount proper.</p>
