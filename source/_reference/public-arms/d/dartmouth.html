<p class="content"> The entry made at the visitation and retained in the College shows no tinctures, but the foregoing are believed to be correct. The design upon the present seal is somewhat different and more in accordance with the arms as quoted in Burke's " General Armory " — namely. Gules the base wavy of six argent and azure, thereon the hulk of a ship, in the centre of which sits a man representing a king in the robes of majesty, crowned with an open coronet, in his dexter hand a sceptre, in his sinister a mound, on each side a lion rampant guardant resting their forefeet on the shoulders of the king, all or. Berry adds this note: — " This seems to be the fancy of some painter, formed on an inspection of the Corporation Seal, wh. is very ancient, and represents the hulk of a ship on waves ; in the centre of the vessel a bust of a man, vested over the shoulder, and cro)vned with an antique coronet; on the dexter side in chief a crescent, on the sinister a mullet of six .points ; on each side the bust of a demi-lion issuing from the dexter and sinister sides of the seal, and resting his forelegs on the vessel.
