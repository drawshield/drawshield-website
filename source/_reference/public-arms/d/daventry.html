<p class="content"><span class="entry">DAVENTRY </span>(Northamptonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a man standing upon a mount between the figures 15 and 95, holding over his dexter shoulder an axe, and in his sinister hand one of the branches of a tree growing out of the mound. The legend upon the seal which has been sent to me is " Sigillum commune burgi de Danetre. N.S." Burke and Berry quote spellings of the legend both differing from the foregoing and from each other.</p>
