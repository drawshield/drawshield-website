<p class="content"><span class="entry">DERBY </span>(Derbyshire). Has no armorial bearings. Those usually quoted and in general use are " Argent, on a mount vert, a stag lodged all within park-pales and a gate, all proper." The seal, which is very ancient, simply represents a stag as lodged in a wood.</p>
