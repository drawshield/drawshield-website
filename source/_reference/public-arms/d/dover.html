<p class="content"><span class="entry">DOVER </span>(Kent). [Argent] St Martin on horseback with a beggar [all proper], a bordure [gules] sem6 of lions [passant guardant or].</p>
<p class="content"> At the Visitation of Kent in 1574, the entry relating to Dover runs : " The Armes of the Towne and Port of Dover Incorporate by the name of the 'Mayor and Jurates' in the tyme of Edward III." Then follow sketches described as " The comon Seale of the Towne and Port of Dover" (a representation of St Martin on horseback issuing from a city gate, together with a beggar and all within a circular border seme of lions guardant passant and counterpassant), "the reverse of the said comon seal" (a ship at sea, etc.) and "The Mayor's Seal," which has the arms showing three dimidiated lions passant guardant, and hulks of ships which seem to be in use in the Cinque Ports.</p>
<p class="content"> The fact that the Visitation entry begins " the armes " places their status beyond doubt, and this is confirmed by an ancient MS. book in the College of Arms (not, however, an official record) which gives the arms of Dover as the device of St Martin and the beggar with a bordure seme of lions. In this, however, the castellated gateway is omitted.</p>
