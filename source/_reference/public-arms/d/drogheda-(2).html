<p class="content"><span class="entry">DROGHEDA </span>(Co. Louth). Has no armorial bearings. In Burke's "General Armory " the following are quoted: — " Az., per pale dimidiated, on the dexter side three lions pass, guard, in pale or, on the sinister as many hulls of ships in pale of the last, surmounted by a castle with two towers triple-towered argent. N.B. — The small seal of Drogheda exhibits on the shield az. three crescents issuant therefrom as many ectoiles all ar." But the armorial bearings as they appear to be used and as they are quoted in the Dublin Penny Magazine, 4th May, 1833, are azure (upon a mount) an embattled gateway of two towers argent, portcullis sable, surmounted by pennons gules, on the dexter three lions of England issuant or, on the sinister appearing to sail behind the gate, a ship having St George's ensign displayed over her stern. Crest — On a wreath a star within the horns of a crescent argent. Motto — " Deus presidium mercatura decus."</p>
