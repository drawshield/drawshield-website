<p class="content"><span class="entry">DUMFRIES </span>(Dumfriesshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal represents the figure of a saint mitred, a wing attached to his dexter shoulder and holding in his sinister hand a crosier with the legend " Sigillum burgi de Dumfreis."</p>
<p class="content"> The following blazon has, however, been supplied to the editor as the arms of Dumfries: — "Argent, the Archangel Michael proper, vested in long garments azure, in his dexter hand a crosier, on his head a mitre, below his feet a serpent nowed both proper." No illustration of this has been available, and as the editor is not familiar with St Michael in this disguise he must be excused from any emblazonment thereof The " Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland " simply gives the seal.</p>
