<p class="content"><span class="entry">DUNBLANE </span>(Perthshire). Has no armorial bearings. The design upon the burgh seal is suggested by an old ecclesiastical seal. On the dexter side is St Laurence, and on the sinister side is a bishop (? St Blane), mitred and robed, his dexter hand raised in the action of benediction, and his sinister holding his crosier.</p>
