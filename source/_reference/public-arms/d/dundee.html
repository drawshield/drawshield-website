<p class="content"><span class="entry">DUNDEE </span>(Forfarshire). The entry in Lyon Register is as follows: — "The Royall Burgh of Dundie gives for Ensig7ies Annoriall azure a pott of growing lillies argent. The escutcheon being supported by two dragons their taills nowed together underneath vert, with this word in ane escroU above a lillie growing out of the top of the shield as the former. Dei Doiium."</p>
<p class="content"> Confirmed to the Royal Burgh of Dundee by Sir Charles Araskine of Cambo, Lyon King of Arms, 30th July 1673.</p>
<p class="content"> The deed of confirmation is still in the possession of the Corporation, but this has no painting upon it.</p>
<p class="content"> The blazon as in the Lyon Register shows several discrepancies. In the first place, the supporters are termed dragons, whereas they are always represented as wyverns, and secondly the motto also is quoted " Dei Domum," whilst there can be little doubt that it is intended for Dei Donum, and as no official painting accompanies the blazon in the records, it is doubtful in what manner the crest is intended to be used. The usual method of depicting it is issuing from a wreath in the ordinary manner as shown in the plate.</p>
<p class="content"> A second motto, " Prudentia et candore," appears to be frequently made use of below the arms, but, so far as the editor is aware, without any authority.</p>
