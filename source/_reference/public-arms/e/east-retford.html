<p class="content"><span class="entry">EAST RETFORD </span>(Nottinghamshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which is very ancient and of very crude workmanship, represents, to quote Berry and Burke, two eagles with wings inverted and endorsed, the inner feet conjoined, with the legend " Sigillu de Este Rettfurthe istut." Berry adds a note — " It is not unlikely that the charges thereon were originally assigned to the Corporation as Arms . . . the colours are unknown." Burke adds a note — " A rose with a lion of England upon a chief is engraved as the Arms of this town upon some of the oldest plate belonging to the Corporation."</p>
