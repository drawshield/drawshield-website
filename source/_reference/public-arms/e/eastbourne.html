<p class="content"><span class="entry">EASTBOURNE </span>(Sussex). Has no armorial bearings. On the Corporation seal is a representation of a bogus coat-of-arms, which also appears on the notepaper as follows: — "Argent on a fesse between four bars gules, a rose between two stags' heads caboshed " (evidently taken from the Cavendish Arms). For a Crest, appears a sea-horse presumably proper, though the Corporation of Eastbourne evidently consider that a wreath to support the crest is a bygone and undesirable appendage. Motto — " Meliora sequimur."</p>
