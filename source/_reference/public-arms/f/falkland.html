<p class="content"><span class="entry">FALKLAND </span>(Fifeshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal, which is of very rude workmanship, represents upon a mount, and in front of a tree growing therefrom, a stag lodged regardant. The legend is, " Discite justitiam moniti temnere Christum."</p>
