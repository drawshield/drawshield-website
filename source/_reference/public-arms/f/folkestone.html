<p class="content"><span class="entry">FOLKESTONE </span>(Kent). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents upon waves of the sea an antique ship of one mast, the sail furled, towered at each end, a man's head appearing above the battlements of each, and at the masthead a turret, and a man in the body of the boat, and another in the stern turret. The picture postcards represent the arms to be " Azure, on waves of the sea proper a lymphad or, sails furled and flags flying."</p>
