<p class="content"><span class="entry">FORRES </span>(Elginshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal, which is of remarkably fine workmanship, represents the figure of St Laurence crowned with a nimbus, holding a book (sic. in the Cat. of Her. Exn., but query a casket) in his right hand, his left resting on a gridiron. In the field are a crescent, a star of six points, and two branches of foliage. Legend, " Sigillum commune burgi de Fores."</p>
