<p class="content"><span class="entry">FORTROSE </span>(Rossshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal at present in use, which is circular; represents the figures of St Peter and St Boniface, to whom the Cathedral Church is dedicated. St Peter on the dexter side has a halo, and is holding his keys over his dexter shoulder. St Boniface on the sinister side is wearing a mitre and holding a crosier in his sinister hand. A more ancient seal, which is oval in shape, represents St Peter only, though this time in a mitre.</p>
