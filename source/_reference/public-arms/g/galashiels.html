<p class="content"><span class="entry">GALASHIELS </span>(Selkirkshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal represents upon a mount a vine-tree fructed proper and seated upon either side a fox gazing at the fruit, all within the legend, "The Corporation of the Burgh of Galashiels." [Does the fruit typify a coat-of-arms which the Borough can't afford ?]</p>
