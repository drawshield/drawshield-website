<p class="content"><span class="entry">GLAMORGANSHIRE. </span>Has no armorial bearings. The Clerk of the County Council informs me that " the Seal adopts the Arms of De Clare, who were (sic) Lords of Glamorgan." These are, of course, the arms Cardiff formerly assumed. It's a pity they couldn't find a better example to copy, particularly as the City of Cardiff has now seen the error of its ways.</p>
