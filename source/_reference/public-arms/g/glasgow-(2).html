Argent, on a mount in base vert an oak-tree proper, the stem at the base thereof surmounted by a salmon on its back also proper with a signet ring in its mouth or, on the top of the tree a redbreast and in the sinister fesse point an ancient hand-bell both also proper.</p>

<p class="content"> [No arms were ever matriculated in Lyon Register for the See of Glasgow. Archbishop Burnet, who matriculated his arms c. 1672-7, did so without any Episcopal impalement. But the device above quoted appears upon some early Episcopal seals.]</p>
