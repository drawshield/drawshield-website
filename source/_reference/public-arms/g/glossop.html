<p class="content"><span class="entry">GLOSSOP </span>(Derbyshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal of the corporation represents upon a chapeau proper a lion statant guardant with tail extended, and underneath the motto, " Virtus Veritas libertas." The above crest is, of course, that of Lord Howard of Glossop ; it would be interesting to know if any member of the Howard family sanctioned this appropriation.</p>
