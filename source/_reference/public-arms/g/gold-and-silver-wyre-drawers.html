<p class="content"><span class="entry">GOLD AND SILVER WYRE DRAWERS, </span>The Worshipful Company of, London. (Incorporated i6th June 1693.) Azure, on a chevron or, between two coffers of the second in chief and two points in saltire in base argent, a drawingiron between two rings [i.e. tools used by the craft) sable. Ciest — On a wreath of the colours, two arms embowed vested gules, cuffed argent, holding between the hands proper an engiossing block or. Supporters — (Dexter) an Indian proper, crowned with an Eastern crown or, vested round the middle with feathers pendant alternately argent and gules, holding over his shoulder a bar of silver ; (sinister) a man vested proper (" called in the grant a silk throwster"), in his sinister hand a hank of silk argent. Motto — " Amicitiam trahit amor."</p>
<p class="content"> [These arms are of no authority, no record of any grant or confirmation being in existence at the College of Arms. The blazon is taken from Burke's Armory, which has the note referring to the grant, and this seems to have been derived from Edmondson's " Heraldry." How it can have originated it is difficult to imagine, as the Company knows nothing of any grant]</p>
