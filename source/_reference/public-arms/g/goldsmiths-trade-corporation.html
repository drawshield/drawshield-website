<p class="content"><span class="entry">GOLDSMITHS' TRADE CORPORATION </span>(Edinburgh). Qrly. i and 4 a leopard's face argent, 2 and 3 azure, a covered cup or, in chief two annulets of the last, enriched with stones gules.</p>
<p class="content"> [Not matriculated in Lyon Register. Refer sub Edinburgh.] This is evidently a variation upon the London Goldsmiths' Company. Their arms are based upon the London Hall-mark, and that upon the Royal leopards, hence the leopard's face for Edinburgh is rather ridiculous. But the copying of other people's arms leads to these little follies.</p>
