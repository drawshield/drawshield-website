<p class="content"><span class="entry">HENLEY-UPON-THAMES </span>(Oxfordshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal at present in use represents the letter H crowned with a five-leaved ducal coronet, above which are rays of the sun issuing from behind clouds, and the Legend " Sigillum Gardiani ville de Henley." Debrett's " House of Commons " gives an older seal showing a lion rampant. As to this the following extract from "Berry" may be some explanation : — •</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Henley-upon-Thames, Berkshire .... a lion rampant, .... as appears by a seal pendent to a deed dated 1306. The Corporation-seal, in the year 1624, appears to be the letter H, ducally crowned ; in chief clouds issuing rain : with this impression the money coined at Henley was stamped, as appears by the Visitation of Berks, in which the same is entered as the seal of this corporation, and with this legend round it. Villa; de Henley Sigillum."
