<p class="content"><span class="entry">HERTFORD, </span>Town of (Hertfordshire.) Argent, a hart lodged resting on water proper.</p>
<p class="content"> Recorded in the College of Arms.</p>
<p class="content"> Burke's "General Armory" gives the arms with which the town is generally credited, namely, " Argent on a mount vert, a hart lodged gules " As is the case with the county the hart is sometimes placed in a ford, and trippant or statant. The seal, however, represents a hart statant in a ford in front of a tree, and a castle triple-towered and domed in the background.</p>
