<p class="content"><span class="entry">HUNTINGDON, </span>Town of (Huntingdonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a landscape, in the centre of which is a tree, on the dexter side of which is a bird perched, on the sinister side of the tree is a huntsman (supposed to represent Robin Hood) blowing a horn, in his sinister hand a bow and arrow, on the dexter side a stag courant pursued by two dogs, all proper. The legend is "Sigillum communitatis de Huntirisoune, 1628."</p>
