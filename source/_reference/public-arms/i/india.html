<p class="content"><span class="entry">INDIA. </span>Strange as it may appear, no arms have ever been assigned by warrant or otherwise to the Empire of India as a whole, or to any of the subdivisions. At the coronation of King George V. a banner, " argent, on a cross gules the Star of India, surmounted by a Royal Crown," was carried for India, but this was neither granted nor assigned but merely "approved" by His Majesty. The Viceroy of India in India uses the Union Jack charged with the device of the Star of India and Crown as above described.</p>
