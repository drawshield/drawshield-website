<p class="content"><span class="entry">IRVINE </span>(Ayrshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal at present in use, which is of exquisite workmanship, appears to be an amalgamation of the designs upon three older seals, and represents as resting upon a mount an escutcheon charged with the Royal Crest of Scotland. Upon the dexter side of the escutcheon seated under a canopy is the Holy Virgin and Child, and on the sinister side a lion sejant guardant erect, royally crowned and holding between its forepaws a tree eradicated proper ; and upon an escroll above the escutcheon the Motto, " Tandem bona causa triumphat." The Legend is " Sigillo commune Burgi de Irvine."</p>
