<p class="content"><span class="entry">KENDAL </span>(Westmoreland). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents presumably (?) a view of the town, the only inscription being 15KK76. A coatof-arms has been sent to me, but it defies description. It is quarterly gules and azure in the first and fourth quarters three . . . and in the second and third three ... all or. Motto — " Pannus mihi panis."</p>
