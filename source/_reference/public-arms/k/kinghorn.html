<p class="content"><span class="entry">KINGHORN </span>(Fifeshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal which has been forwarded to me represents a triple-towered castle, each tower domed and the centre tower ensigned with a cross pattee, and on either side of the castle a mullet of five points. The editor thinks there may be some connection between this seal and the arms of Kirkcaldy (to which refer). The Catalogue of the Heraldic E.vhibition in Edinburgh mentions three seals, two as described above, and another representing a full-length figure of St Leonard.</p>
