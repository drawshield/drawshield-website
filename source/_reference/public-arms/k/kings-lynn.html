<p class="content"><span class="entry">KING'S LYNN </span>or LYNN REGIS (Norfolk). Azure, three dragons' heads erased and erect or, in the mouth of each a cross crosslet fitchee also erect of the last. These are quoted by Burke, and are usually drawn as conger eels' heads, but they should be dragons according to the record in Visitation Books at the College of Arms. A crest is made use of, namely, a pelican vulning herself, but this is of no authority.</p>
<p class="content"> The dragons' heads from which issue the crosses are said to typify St Margaret, the patron saint of the town. The old legend respecting this saint may or may not be familiar. In her early youth being converted into the modes of thought and habit then current under the guise of Christianity, she was compelled to fly from her home. She became a shepherdess in far-off lands, when the wicked lord of the country being enamoured of her beauty sought, against the lady's wish, to obtain possession of her. St Margaret being obstreperous, was cast into the inevitable dungeon, in which she had the company, more or less inviting, of the equally inevitable dragon. Being greatly terrified, she became an easy prey to the beast, who seems to have been in the habit of bolting its food, for St Margaret only recovered her wits in her new quarters inside the dragon. She commenced to pray, making the sign of the cross, when immediately the creature burst open and St Margaret was, according to history, little the worse for her adventure.</p>
