<p class="content"> Recorded in the College of Arms.</p>
<p class="content"> The seal shows this escutcheon, but in base the letter R (? for Regis or Royal), and it so appears upon the seal of the County Council of Surrey. Burke's "General Armory," quotes the salmon as haurient, and mentions a seal representing a tun, and over it a Saxon K, the whole encircled b\- two olive branches.</p>
