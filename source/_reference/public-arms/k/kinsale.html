<p class="content"><span class="entry">KINSALE </span>(Co. Cork). Chequy argent and sable. These arms are not registered in Ulster's Office but appear upon a seal of the Corporation which has the legend, " The Armes of the Corporation of Kinsale." A tree, and a bird perched on a dexter branch thereof, appears to be growing from the top of the escutcheon. This may perhaps be intended for a Crest; but in another seal it simply appears as a foliated ornament.</p>
