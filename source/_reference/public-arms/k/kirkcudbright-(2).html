<p class="content"><span class="entry">KIRKCUDBRIGHT </span>(County of Kirkcudbright). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal at present in use represents a three-masted ship with sails furled. But a copy of a more ancient one, which represents upon an escutcheon an antique one-masted ship, and seated therein the Virgin and Child, apparently does duty for armorial insignia, being embossed upon the Town Clerk's notepaper.</p>
