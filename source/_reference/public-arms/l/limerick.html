<p class="content"><span class="entry">LIMERICK, </span>City of (Co. Limerick). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. Burke, however, in his " General Armory," quotes the following: — "Quarterly ist and 4th gu. a castle, on each tower an obtuse spire with a weathercock, on an arch over the curtain wall a cross flory ar. ; 2nd and 3rd gu. three lions of England or." The Town-Clerk writes that the arms of the city are correctly blazoned as the foregoing ; but both the seals of the city show simply a castle upon the escutcheon, which does not answer the above description. It would be well if some one would get the arms recorded and confirmed in Ulster's Office to establish an accepted coat. Motto — " Urbs antiqua fuit studiisque asperrima belli."</p>
