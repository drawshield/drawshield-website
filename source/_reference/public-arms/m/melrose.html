<p class="content"><span class="entry">MELROSE </span>(Co. Roxburgh). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. Those upon the seal are " Azure, a hind's or lamb's head erased from which issues the head of a bishop's crosier, in chief on the dexter side a mason's ' mell ' {i.e. a mallet), and on the sinister a rose." The use of the device of the mel and the rose dates back to 1505.</p>
