<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEW GALLOWAY </span>(Wigtownshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The Town-Clerk forwarded an engraved representation of the following arms. It is a pity they are not matriculated, because in their present form they are absolutely unique. Gules, on a cross couped argent, the upper part thereof enfiled with a coronet showing nine small pearls upon the rim, a boar's head erased proper, above the escutcheon is placed a peer's helmet and a lambrequin, and thereupon on a wreath a boar's head erased, as in the arms for a Crest. Above the Crest appears another coronet, also as in the arms. For Supp07-tcrs — On the dexter side a savage wreathed about the head and waist with laurel, and holding over his exterior shoulder a club all proper, and on the sinister side a ram also proper. Motto — " Cruce crescimus." The legend upon the seal is " Sigillum commune burgi Gallouidise."</p>
