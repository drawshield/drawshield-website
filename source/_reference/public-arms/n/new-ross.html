<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEW ROSS </span>or ROSS (Co. Wexford). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. Both the seals represent on a bridge of five arches over water a stag and a greyhound in full course towards the sinister, the dog with its head regardant biting at the neck of the stag. The device is not unlike that of Clonmel.</p>
