<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEWPORT </span>(Monmouthshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents an escutcheon, "... charged with a chevron reversed or." The Corporation notepaper shows it" Azure, a chevron reversed or," and the Town-Clerk, writing, informs the editor that the arms are, " Or, chevron gules reversed," adding a note, " The Arms are stated to be the same as those of the Duke of Buckingham, who was Lord of Newport in Richard's the Third's time, but with the chevron reversed." All representations of the arms (on the seal and elsewhere) are surmounted by a cherub with wings expanded and inverted, but with no wreath. It seems a pity somebody doesn't interest himself in the matter, and get arms granted to the town, and thus secure some uniformity and some authoritative accuracy.</p>
