<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEWRY </span>(Cos. Down and Armagh). Has no armorial bearings registered in Ulster's Office. The seal represents on a mount a bishop enthroned, his right hand raised in the act of benediction, and with his sinister supporting his cross, all between two poplar (?) trees growing out of the mount. This has frequently been treated and quoted as a coat-of-arms.</p>
