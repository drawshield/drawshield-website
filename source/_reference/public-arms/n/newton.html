<p class="content"><span class="entry">NEWTON </span>(Lancashire). Has no armorial bearings, but the seal represents a ram's head issuing from a ducal coronet, and holding in its mouth a sprig of laurel all proper. Within the legend, " Sigillum burgi ac leti de Newton." This is quoted in Burke's " General Armory " as the crest of Newton, but it is really the crest of the old family of Legh, formerly resident there.</p>
