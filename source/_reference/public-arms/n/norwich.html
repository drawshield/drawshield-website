<p class="content"> [Confirmed by Hervey, Clarenceux King of Arms.]</p>
<p class="content"> Upon the Town-Clerk's notepaper the arms are surmounted by a fur cap, and are supported by two angels, with wings inverted, holding over the interior shoulder a sword point upwards, and each standing upon a little pile of clouds. On a carving of the City Arms outside the Guildhall, Norwich, which is stated to date from 1534, the arms are surmounted by a representation of the fur cap (formerly, at Norwich, worn by the Mayor) and are accompanied by figures of two angels. Whether or not these figures were then intended for heraldic supporters is a matter of dispute. At any rate, there is no official authority for their use.</p>
