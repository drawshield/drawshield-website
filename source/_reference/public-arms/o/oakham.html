<p class="content"><span class="entry">OAKHAM </span>(Rutland). Has no armorial bearings. But the following are regularly used and quoted, " Or, a horse-shoe sable, nailed argent." The old legend is that when passing through the town Queen Elizabeth's horse lost a shoe, and the town thereupon acquired the privilege of claiming a horse-shoe from an\- royal personage or nobleman entering its precincts.</p>
