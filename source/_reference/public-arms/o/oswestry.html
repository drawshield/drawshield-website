<p class="content"><span class="entry">OSWESTRY </span>(Shropshire). Has no armorial bearings. Those in use are " Gules, a cross couped argent, between four lions rampant or." Motto — " Floreat Oswestria."</p>
<p class="content"> Morris, in his " Armorial Bearings of Shropshire Families," quotes these arms "gu. a cross between four lions rampant or," but neither form has any authority.</p>
<p class="content"> The seal represents a figure of King Oswald crowned and seated on a throne, holding in his dexter hand a sword, the sinister grasping a tree.</p>
