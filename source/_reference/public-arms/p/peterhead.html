<p class="content"><span class="entry">PETERHEAD </span>(Aberdeenshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal, however, which bears the legend " Town of Peterhead," e.xhibits what is probably intended for the achievement of Keith, Earl Marischal of Scotland, namely, Argent, on a chief or, three pallets gules. This should of course be. Argent, on a chief gules, three pallets or. Crest — A hart's head proper. Motto —</p>
<pre class="quotation">
" Veritas vincit." Behind the escutcheon are placed the two batons appertaining to the office of Earl Marischal. Upon the Town-Clerk's notepaper, and within the legend, " Police Commissioners and Town Council of Peterhead," appears the same achievement though here the batons are omitted, the error in the chief is corrected, but a coronet, a peer's helmet, a lambrequin and two harts as supporters are introduced. The coronet is one unknown to the editor as a coronet of rank, in which guise it appears, being placed below the helmet.
