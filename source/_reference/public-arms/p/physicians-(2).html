<p class="content"><span class="entry">PHYSICIANS, </span>College of (Dublin). (College constituted by Charles II., and arms granted by St George, Ulster, 25th August 1667.) Per fesse argent and azure in the middle of the chief a celestial hand issuing out of a cloud feeling the pulse of a terrestrial hand all proper, and in base the royal harp of Ireland, as a distinction from the arms of the like College in England. Motto — " Ratione et experientia."</p>
