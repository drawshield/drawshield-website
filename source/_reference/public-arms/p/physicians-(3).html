<p class="content"><span class="entry">PHYSICIANS, </span>King and Queen's College of (Ireland). (College reconstituted 29th September 1692, and arms regranted by Burke, Ulster, 1S63. By a new Charter this is now The Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.) Per fesse ermine and azure, a dexter celestial hand issuing out of clouds in chief proper, and in base the harp of Ireland ensigned with the royal crown, all also proper. Motto — " Ratione et experientia."</p>
