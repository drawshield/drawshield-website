<p class="content"><span class="entry">PORT-GLASGOW </span>(Renfrewshire). Has not matriculated any armorial bearings. The seal represents a ship of three masts under full sail upon the sea, the mainsail charged with a tree, a fish, a bell, and a bird, being the arms of the City of Glasgow. From the main-mast flies the Union Jack, and at the stern the banner of St Andrew. Below is the inscription, " Ter et quater anno revisens aequor Atlanticum impune," all within the legend, "Common Seal of the Towns of Port-Glasgow and Newark."</p>
