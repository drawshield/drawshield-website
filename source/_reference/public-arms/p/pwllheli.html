<p class="content"><span class="entry">PWLLHELI </span>(Carnarvonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The following is, however, attributed to the Town : "... On a mount an elephant passant, on his back a castle, his trunk extended between two palm-trees all proper." This, of course, is taken from the common seal, which shows this design, with the legend, " Sigillum communitis ville de Porthely."</p>
