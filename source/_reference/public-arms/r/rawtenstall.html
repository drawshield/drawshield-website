<p class="content"><span class="entry">RAWTENSTALL </span>(Lancashire). Or, on a fesse gules, between two stags trippant at gaze in chief proper and a mount in base vert, thereon two cows grazing and respecting each other sable, a wolf current of the first between two bales of wool of the third, in the chief point a sinister hand couped at the wrist of the second. Crest — On a wreath of the colours, upon a mount a squirrel sejant cracking a nut between two sprigs of the cotton-tree, slipped, leaved, and fructed, all proper. Motto — " Floret qui laborat."</p>
