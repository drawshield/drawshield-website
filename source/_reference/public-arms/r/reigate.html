<p class="content"><span class="entry">REIGATE </span>(Surrey). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, the design upon which is sometimes quoted as the " Arms " of the town, represents in front of a tree an embattled gateway with portcullis, and below is the motto, " Never wonne ne never shall." In the gateway below the portcullis are the letters REI. Over the battlements is an escutcheon chequy, and on either side is an escutcheon bearing a monogram.</p>
