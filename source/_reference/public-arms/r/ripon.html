<p class="content"><span class="entry">RIPON </span>(Yorkshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a buglehorn stringed, the mouthpiece to the dexter, with the letters Rippon arranged within and about the loops of the string. Burke in his " General Armory " blazons this as a coat, making the field gules and the bugle-horn and letters or. The Town-Clerk's notepaper shows a coat-of-arms, " Argent, a bugle-horn chained."</p>
