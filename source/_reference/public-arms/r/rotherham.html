<p class="content"><span class="entry">ROTHERHAM </span>(Yorkshire). Has no armorial bearings, but a device appears to be made use of. It consists of a bridge supporting two escutcheons, namely, on the dexter side, "Azure, three cannon mounted on their carriages in pale . . ." and on the sinister side, "Vert, three stags trippant, two and one." Motto — " Sic virescit industria."</p>
