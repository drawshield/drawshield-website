<p class="content"><span class="entry">SCARBOROUGH </span>(Yorkshire). Has no armorial bearings. The arms of Lumley (Earls of Scarborough), " Argent, a fesse gules between three popinjays vert," are sometimes quoted as belonging to the town, but a copy of the seal usually answers the purposes of insignia. This, which is very ancient, shows a ship, a watch-tower, and a star. Legend, " Sigillum comune Burgensin de Scardeburg."</p>
