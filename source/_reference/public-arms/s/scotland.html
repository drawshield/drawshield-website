<p class="content"> The Act of Union provided that the Arms of the United Kingdom should be declared by Her Majesty, and one version for the United Kingdom was called into being. No warrant for any special version of the Royal Arms for use in Scotland has ever been issued, but for the purposes of the Great Seal of Scotland a special design was submitted to King Edward VII., who approved the same by Order in Council, nth August 1903. The seal is illustrated and described in the Report of the Deputy-Master of the Mint for 1904, and annexed to the illustration is the following description of " The Royal Arms of Scotland," viz. : — Anns — Quarterly, First and Fourth, or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory, counterflory gules ; Second, gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or ; Third, azure, a harp or, stringed argent. The shield is surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Thistle with the St Andrew pendant therefrom. Crest — On the Royal Crown proper, a lion sejant aff'rontee gules, holding in his dexter paw a sword and in his sinister a sceptre erect, also proper. Supporters — De.xter, a unicorn argent, armed, crlned and unguled or, gorged with a coronet composed of crosses pattee and fleurs-de-lis, a chain affixed thereto, reflexed over the back and fastened to a staple below, of the last, and holding erect a lance ensigned with the flag of Scotland, azure, a saltire argent. Sinister, a lion guardant or, crowned with the Royal crown proper, holding erect a lance ensigned with the flag of England argent, a cross gules. Motto — Over the crest, "In defens." [The seal itself shows the unicorn crowned with a similar crown to the lion, which fact is omitted in the description.] A similar design appears upon the</p>

<p class="content"> Great Seal of Scotland of King George V. This order in Council is in Scotland held to authorise this version of the Royal Arms for general use in that country, but it really has no such legal effect. If either king had intended or desired such a result, the intention would have been declared by a proper Warrant issued in a proper way. Arms for the United Kingdom are one thing, arms for that part of it called Scotland are another, but the foregoing design is neither.</p>
