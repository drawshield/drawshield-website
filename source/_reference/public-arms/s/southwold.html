<p class="content"><span class="entry">SOUTHWOLD </span>(Suffolk). (Sable), two arrows in saltire enfiled with a ducal coronet (or). Crest — The bust of a man couped at the breast, vested and regally crowned.</p>
<p class="content"> Recorded in the College of Arms, but no colours are given.</p>
<p class="content"> The seal represents this coat upon an escutcheon, but with the addition of the letter S (reversed) in base; and here the coronet is composed of two cinquefoils and three fleurs-de-lis. The shield is surmounted by an esquire's helmet and mantling, and has for the crest the figure of a man couped at the breast and vested, but the head-covering is more like a mitre than a regal Crown. The legend is "They Ryght defend." [The illustration .shows the arms and crest as they appear upon the seal, and in the form they are used.]</p>
