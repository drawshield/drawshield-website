<p class="content"><span class="entry">ST. IVES </span>(Huntingdonshire). Has no armorial bearings. Those used are peculiar, and show a lamentable ignorance of heraldry on somebody's part. They are, Quarterly . . . and . . . four bulls' heads. Motto — " Sudore non sopore." Though the partition lines are very plainly en evidence, all four quarters are marked gules. The bulls' heads are far from heraldic, being neither couped, erased, nor cabossed, but savouring of all three. They have a remarkable resemblance to Messrs Colman's trade-mark. Had the original artist no better copy to guide him than an old mustard tin ?</p>
