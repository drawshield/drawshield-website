<p class="content"><span class="entry">STEWART'S COLLEGE </span>(Edinburgh). Has no armorial bearings. The school is administered by the Company of Merchants of Edinburgh and some use is made of the arms of the Company. But ordinarily the arms in use are supposed to be those of the founder, Daniel Stewart of the Exchequer, a citizen of Edinburgh who died in 1814. These are : Quarterly i and4, or, a lion rampant within a double tressure gules ; 2 and 3 . . . three garbs. . . . Motto — " Never unprepared." There appears to be some doubt about the colours, but the second and third quarters are probably intended for azure, three garbs or. On the school caps, which are black, both garbs and lion are embroidered in red on black, which is probably only a representation in red outline.</p>
