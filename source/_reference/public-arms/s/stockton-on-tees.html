<p class="content"><span class="entry">STOCKTON-ON-TEES </span>(Durham). Has no armorial bearings. A castle in front of and charged upon the stem of an anchor cabled is used as a kind of badge, and sometimes painted sable upon an argent field is displayed as a coat-of-arms. The motto used is " Fortitudo et spes." The badge and motto appear upon the corporation seal with the legend " Sig. Corp. de Stockton sup. Tisam. in. Com. pal. Dunelm"; but upon the seal the anchor is not cabled.</p>
