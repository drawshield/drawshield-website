The seal, which is of most exquisite workmanship, represents a fleur-de-lis, diapered all over with a minute floral design, within the legend " Sig. burgi de Tamworth in comitat. Warwic. et Staf " Engraven round the edge of the seal, " Ex dono Thomae Thynne de maneris de Drayton, Armigeri, anno Dom. 1679."</p>
