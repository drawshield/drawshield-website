<p class="content"><span class="entry">THETFORD </span>(Norfolk). Has no armorial bearings. The seal represents a quadrangular castle embattled and surmounted with a tower, and from this a flag. From each of the outer towers issues a demi-man, that on the dexter side holding a sword, and that on the sinister blowing a horn, all proper.</p>
