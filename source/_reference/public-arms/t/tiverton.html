<p class="content"><span class="entry">TIVERTON </span>(Devonshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which shows a most curious designing, exhibits the castle, church, and town of Tiverton with Lowman's and Exe bridges, and beneath a woolpack. Berry to his description adds the almost needless remark : " The whole seems to be an invention of some engraver." The legend is " Sigillum oppidi de Tyverton."</p>
