<p class="content"><span class="entry">TREGONY </span>(Cornwall). Burke in his "General Armory" gives "... a pomegranate slipped and leaved. . . . Crest — A Cornish chough's head and neck erased sable, holding in the beak a chaplet ermine and sable."</p>
<p class="content"> The arms are informally recorded in the College of Arms, but no colours are marked and no crest is given.</p>
