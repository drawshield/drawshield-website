<p class="content"><span class="entry">ULSTER, </span>Province of (Ireland). Or, a cross gules, on an inescutcheon argent a dexter hand couped, also gules. Burke, in his " General Armory," adds a note — " There are two other Coats on record in Ulster's Office as the Arms of the Province, viz.. Or, a lion rampant double queued gules ; and Argent, a dexter hand couped gules." This is peculiar, for the Baronets of Ireland always carry a szm'sfer haitd ; but Sir Bernard Burke certainly quoted the Arms of Ulster as showing a dexter hand, and in the grant of arms to the Royal University of Ireland they are so quoted.</p>
