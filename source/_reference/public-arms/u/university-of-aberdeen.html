<p class="content"> Matriculated 26th day of September 1888.</p>
<p class="content"> The grant (which is printed in " Notes and Queries," 7S. vii. 63) recites</p>
<pre class="quotation">
"that long prior to the passing of the Act 1672, c. 21, Ensigns Armorial were borne by the University and King's College of Aberdeen and by the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen, but that neither Ensigns Armorial were matriculated ; that the said two Universities and Colleges of Aberdeen were united into one University called the University of Aberdeen," etc. The pot of lilies charged with three fishes are sometimes spoken of as the old arms of Aberdeen ; the second quarter are the arms of Keith, Earl Marischal, the third quarter are the arms of Elphinstone, which family now represents the Keith family ; and the fourth quarter is probably taken from the arms of the city, to which refer.
