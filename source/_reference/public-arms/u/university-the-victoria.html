<p class="content"><span class="entry">UNIVERSITY, THE VICTORIA </span>(Manchester). Party per pale argent and gules, a rose counterchanged between in chief a terrestrial globe semee of bees volant and a golden fleece, and in base a cormorant holding in the beak a branch of seaweed called laver, all proper, together with this Motto — " Olim armis nunc studiis."</p>
<p class="content"> [Recorded, College of Arms.]</p>
<p class="content"> The rose is, of course, that of Lancaster and York conjoined ; the globe is the crest of Manchester, the cormorant of Liverpool, and the fleece is taken from the arms of Leeds, the three principal Colleges of the University being situated in those towns.</p>
