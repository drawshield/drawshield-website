<p class="content"><span class="entry">WARWICK </span>(Warwickshire). Has no armorial bearings. The seal, which is recorded in the visitation books of the College of Arms, represents upon a sable field, and issuing from battlements in base, a castle triple-towered argent, from each of the outer towers issues a demi-huntsman winding his horn (? all proper), and on the centre tower is pendent an escutcheon sable charged with a ragged staff in bend argent. On the dexter side of the castle is a star, and on the sinister side is a crescent.</p>
