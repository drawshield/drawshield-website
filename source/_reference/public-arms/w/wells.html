<p class="content"><span class="entry">WELLS </span>(Somersetshire). The collections of Vincent, preserved in the College of Arms, give a coat upon a field argent a mount in base, therefrom issuing a tree, and at the foot thereof three wells, all of which he labels proper. This within the legend, " Hoc fonte derivata copia in patriam populumque fluit," is illustrated in Debrett's " House of Commons " more in the form of a seal. The arms as used (see illustration), and as quoted by Burke and Berry are, " Party per fesse argent and vert, a tree proper issuing from the fesse line, in base three wells, two and one, masoned proper," with a motto as quoted in the foregoing legend. Berry adds a note, " These Arms are somewhat doubtful, as Mr Edmondson, upon strict inquiry, and consulting the records of the city, could not find the blazon or description of any Arms belonging to it." The " General Armory" gives details of the " Corporation Seal," which " represents a tree from the root, whereof runs a spring of water, on the sinister thereof stands a stork picking up a fish, on the dexter is another bird resembling a Cornish chough.</p>
