<p class="content"><span class="entry">WHITEHAVEN </span>(Cumberland). Has no armorial bearings. The designer of the seal not being content with one bogus escutcheon, must needs invent two, one showing a ship in full sail passing the pier-head, the other displaying the buildings and outhouses at the mouth of a mine. In the blank space at the top of the seal is shown a range of mountains and a railway embankment complete, with signal-box and signal-post, and a railway locomotive and tender, and attached thereto a train of railway waggons. Motto — " Vincit omnia perseverantia." (.One wishes a little of the heraldic ignorance could be overcome.) The legend upon the seal is "Town of Whitehaven, 1863." The " Seal of the Trustees of the Town and Harbour of Whitehaven " exhibits, with other historical and literary matter, an escutcheon decidedly unique. It is evidently suggested by the arms of Lord Lonsdale, and displays without tinctures six annulets, three, two, and one, and on a chief the word " Persevere." This, however, may certainly be nothing more than a peculiar way of showing a motto. Lord Lonsdale's arms are, or, six annulets three, two, and one sable ; so I presume, if colours be wanted, the foregoing blazon would supply them. Whitehaven evidently goes in for variety. It is a pity that, as far as it is concerned all is so very bogus.</p>
