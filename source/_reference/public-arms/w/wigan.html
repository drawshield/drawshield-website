<p class="content"><span class="entry">WIGAN </span>(Lancashire). Has no armorial bearings. The present seal, which is oval in shape, represents a building supported upon columns and surmounted by a belfry. In front of the building is a balcony, and above the roof, upon the dexter side of the belfry, is a sword in pale. The legend is, "Sigillum commune villae et burgi de Wigan." Three seals, very different from the above, were recorded at the visitation.</p>
