<p class="content"><span class="entry">WORCESTER </span>(Worcestershire). Has two distinct coats-of-arms, both of which are recorded in the visitation books in the College of Arms. (Visitation of Worcestershire, 1634.) They are described as "the antient and modern armes " respectively. The former being, "Quarterly sable and gules, a tower triple towered argent," and the latter being, " Argent, a fesse between three pears sable." The good people of Worcester usually release themselves from the difficulty of a decision between the relative claims of the two by placing the latter coat as a dexter canton upon the former ; but beyond long custom, I know of no legal authority for such a proceeding. Berry takes the bull by the horns and blazons the combination as the authentic coat of the city. I am indebted to Burke's " General Armory " for the following legend : —</p>

" Worcester, City of— Quarterly sa. and gu. a castle, triple-towered ar. These arms appear in the Visitation of 1569. A second coat was subsequently adopted by the City, and there is a local tradition that it was granted by Queen Elizabeth in allusion to a pear-tree in full fruit having been brought into the centre of the city (called 'The Cross'), and there replanted, at the time of her Majesty's visit to Worcester. No grant has been found to confirm this tradition, but the second coat, which is Ar. a fess betw. three pears sa., may nevertheless have been adopted in commemoration of the Queen's visit. It is engraved on Speed's Map of the County, dated 1610, and it appears in the Visitations of 1634 and 1682-3, where it is called the 'Modern Arms ' of the city, the first-named coat being described as the ' Ancient Arms.' The City Mottoes are — ' Florate semper fidelis civitas ' ; ' Civitas in bello in pace fidelis ' ; and ' Semper fidelis, mutare sperno.' "
