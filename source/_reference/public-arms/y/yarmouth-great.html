<p class="content"> This coat-of-arms (without the motto) appears in the visitation books, and is marked, " The usuall armes of the towne of Create Yermouthe at this p'sent." Another coat is also given, namely, "Party per fesse gules and azure, in chief three lions passant guardant in pale or, and in base three herrings naiant argent two and one " ; and this is described as " the owld and auncient armes." Berry says that the original arms, " as appears by the Seal," were azure three herrings in pale argent.</p>
