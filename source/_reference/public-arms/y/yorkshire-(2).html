<p class="content"><span class="entry">YORKSHIRE. </span>If a joke may be pardoned by reason of its antiquity then certainly the time-honoured jest of the " Yorkshireman's Coat-of-Arms " should be here inserted. It has been sometimes drawn, but that is not its point. It is said to consist of " A flea, a fly, and a flitch of bacon," and to these are sometimes added " a magpie."</p>
