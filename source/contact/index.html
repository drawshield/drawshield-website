You can get a good overview of the state of developments by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/drawshield/projects/2">main project page</a>. The wiki pages belonging to each
repository contain articles about coding and design topics, but these are probably a minority interest.</p>

<p>That's me! My name is Karl Wilcox and I am the author of the DrawShield suite of blazonry programs. You can find out more about me, and some of my other projects and interests at <a href="https://karlwilcox.com">http://karlwilcox.com</a>. I write these programs just for fun, and to keep my web development and programming skills up to date, but I also hope that they are useful in teaching the language and art of heraldry and bringing it to a wider audience.
