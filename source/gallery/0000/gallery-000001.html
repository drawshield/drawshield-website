<p>This shield was used by Boutell as the primary example to explain the
language of Blazonry in the Book "Boutell's Heraldry" and was one of my
inspirations for creating DrawShield. My original goal was to develop
the program to the point where it could succesfully draw this shield and
then stop. That was about three years ago now and there's no sign of me
stopping yet</p>

<img src="img/gallery-000001.png" alt="Arms of Petre" class="img-fluid" />

<p class="blazon">Gules, on a bend or between two escallops argent a Cornish Chough
proper between as many cinquefoils azure; and on a chief of the second a
rose of the first seeded gold and barbed vert between two fleurs-de-lis
of the field -- for Petre</p>
