<p>These arms were suggested by a DrawShield user, who provided the following additional information: </p>

<p><em>The arms of Mr Bernard C Martin, retired engineer. The crest is an open fetterlock emblem of tolerance, the chevron rompu a north country church gable. Cadences are in the arms of Professor Stephen Martin retired neuropsychiatrist with a label of 3 points ermine, of Mr Edward Martin deputy head teacher a label of 5 points ermine, of Mr Richard Martin spacecraft engineer and 2nd Lt British Army Reserve a label of a crescent.</em></p>

(The final drawing instructions are not part of the original blazon but position the martlett a little better given the rather large chevron rompu that DrawShield uses)</p>
