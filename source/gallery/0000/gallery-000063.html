<h3>Notes</h3>

<blockquote>These are the arms of Louis Charles d'Albert, the Duke Luynes, father of Louis-Joseph d'Albert Luynes, the lover of Julie
d'Aubigny, known as La Maupin. It was one of the first arms that I had wanted emblazoned. Now that there is a French shield
shape that doesn't crop the lower left mullet, Drawshield is handling it perfectly, making it useful and attractive.</blockquote>
