<pre>
    Pily bendy azure and argent, 
        three fleur de lys or, 
        on a chief gules, five mullets of the third
    -- assumed arms of Jim Burrows
</pre><p><em>(Previously&nbsp;entry&nbsp;no.&nbsp;9882)</em></p>

<p>Arms provided by Jim Burrows, who adds:</p>

<q>As a young man, a half century ago, I wanted my own coat of arms, and assumed these. They feature a pily bendy field because while it is formally defined, it was not known (at least at that time) to have ever been used, thus branding these arms as assumed (or fraudulent, if you are not feeling charitable).</q>

    <q>They borrow elements from various real world Burrow(e)s or Burrough(s) arms. Yes, a Burrough family was granted Azure, three fleur de lys orâ€”take that, France.</q>
