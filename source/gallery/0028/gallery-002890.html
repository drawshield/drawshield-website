<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>Based on entries from: "Saints, Signs, and Symbols" - W. Ellwood Post (pp. 43.) "Church Symbolism" - F.R. Webber (pp. 212, and pp. 373, under "Lily" entry) St. Joseph lived and died in the time BEFORE the advent of heraldry; these arms were attributed to him posthumously by the Catholic Church.</q>
