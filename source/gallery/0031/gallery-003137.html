<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>Arms of the sieur de Cadillac, founder of Detroit. These arms form the basis for the logo of the Cadillac division of General Motors, and a simplified variant is still used on all Cadillac cars. The English form of the shield is because this tracks more closely with the Cadillac logo. The martlets are listed as such because the French "merlettes" (which look like ducks without bills or legs) are unavailable. Historically, the Cadillac logo added a viscount's crown over the whole shield (ahistorically, since the sieur de Cadillac was hardly a viscount). The current Cadillac logo actually excludes the birds altogether, leaving just Or a fess sable in the 1st and 4th quarters.</q>
