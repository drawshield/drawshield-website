<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>The arms were granted on January 14, 1939.

Before this the town used an unofficial device consisting of a white shield bearing a swallow. This is a pun on the town's name, the French hirondelle sounding similar to the town's name. This formed the basis of the crest of the 1939 arms.
