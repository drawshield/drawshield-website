<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>As close as I can get to the Australian coat of arms.
Using a bordure ermine overlaps the quarters, so I changed it to an ermine field with an escutcheon showing the six quarters.
The staff wreathed on the crest should be azure and or
The staff wreathed in the 4th quarter should be vert and gules
The bird in the 4th quarter should be a piping shrike and hence black and white.</q>
