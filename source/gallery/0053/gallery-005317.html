<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The family Réard moved from the Lorraine Region, France, and settled in the fertile agricultural area Hesbaye, Belgium.
The eaglets remind of the Lorraine origin of the family, whereas the red fusils on the white field refer to the Hesbaye area in which the noble family Hamal possessed, in medieval times, dominions and estates. The Hamal shield displays 5 fusils white/red on a red/white field and therefore many local families have taken 5 or 3 fusils in their blazon.

This blazon is currently submitted to the Flemish Heraldic Council for approval.</q>
