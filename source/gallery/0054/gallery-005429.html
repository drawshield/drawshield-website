<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Coat of arms of the noble Grifeo family of Partanna (Sicily, Italy), dating back from the very beginnings of the Norman kingdom of Sicily.

The blazon used is not a perfect replica of the one described in official Italian documentation, but it is the best approximation I've been able to make, with some help of the Discord server. Biggest difference is that the blazon calls for three bends azure in the second half (coloured or),  but that was impossible to properly replicate. Other differences are an attempt to replicate the looks of offical drawings.

A possible version of the original blazon is "or, parted in fess by a barrulet sable, in first half a griffin passant sable placed on top of the partition, in second half three bends azure".</q>
