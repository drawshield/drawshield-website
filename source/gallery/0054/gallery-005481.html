<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Heraldry is governed by the Rules of Tincture: No metal on metal and no tincture on tincture i.e. Divisions of the field and charges must not be of Argent and Or in any combination nor of any colors together. Therefore, gu a fish az on a chief arg a sun or would violate the Rules of Tincture. However, there are many registered arms which do. For example, the above arms of the city of Szczecin (Stettin) in Poland. Fimbriation was originally used to separate such components.</q>
