<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>so my initial plan was to do a quartering of Azure and Or since i've used those colors in the past together and i like how they look, plus it fits nicely with the "rule of tincture".
in quarters 1 and 4 i was trying to put a triforce symbol, but had trouble orienting the triangles. so i decided on a Trillium inverted, which looks similar and is a cool heraldic flower.
in quarters 2 and 3 i originally was going for a certamen buzzer, so i did a Bend wavy, but instead of Cendr√©e (which is very uncommon), i decided to go with Sable to make it pop. for the red button, i originally wanted to put it in the canton but it wasnt working well, so i just decided to charge the bend with a torteau. i actually broke the RoT a bit with the Gules on Sable but alas. I also put a Bordure around it to separate the edges of the Bend from the other quarters.
i chose a Peer's Helmet because i thought it was the best looking helmet, and i kept it Proper.
the Torse and Mantle were both just Azure and Or like the rest
the Crest) is a Monkey, because monke
the motto "Quod Erat Demonstrandum" is something i've liked for a while, it means "(that) which was to be demonstrated" and is found at the end of mathematical proofs. i like it for its mathiness but also because it conveys a sense of completion and perseverence.
all in all i am pretty content with this</q>
