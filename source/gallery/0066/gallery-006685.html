- D’argent à la bande d’azur chargée d’un
 lion d’or posé à plomb, côtoyée de deux cotices
 potencées et contre potencées soudées du même,
 accompagnée de deux étoiles aussi d’azur, une
 en chef et une en pointe. -Source: https://www.commune-rosieres10.fr/-Histoire-de-la-commune-?lang=fr
Argent, a bend azure charged with a lion rampant guardant
 or, cotticed of double cottices potenty and counter-potenty
 soldered of the same between two mullets also of azure,
 one in chief and one in base.
Note: "soldered" (French "soudé" - welded, soldered,
 brazed) means that the cottices take the tincture
 of the ordinary they cottice, while the two spaces
 between the cottices and the ordinary are filled in
 the tincture specified. The purpose of this is to
 prevent violating the rule of tincture
