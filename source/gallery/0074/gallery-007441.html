        // A DrawShield *allegory* of the national coat
//  of arms of the Republic of Colombia

    // It's not completely accurate though, but it
//  is as much as I could using DrawShield.net; the banners
//  as supporters in particular aren't quite like that
//  in the official colombian arms, and the motto should
//  be shown with yellow background, not white.
    // The bird in the official symbol is a condor,
//  but DrawShield's "vulture displayed" for its attitude
//  and longer wings resembles it better.
    // In the official symbol the sinister cornucopia's
//  fruits have their various natural colors (but DrawShield
//  doesn't currently cover that), and the dexter cornucopia
//  shows gold coins instead of fruits (but a cornucopia
//  pouring coins isn't currently available in DrawShield
//  either)
    // Odd charges like the phrygian cap in fess point
//  and the map of the isthmus of Panama I did my best
//  to draw with available charges: green stones for the
//  isthmus, red circles and even a murrey pear for the
//  cap.
    // Finally, "a fillet bordure sable" seems to
//  be present in the original shield, but bordures don't
//  show very well in shields shaped other than "heater"
//  in DrawShield at the moment so such fillet bordure
//  was ommited.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>An improved version over one submitted before (Changes: condor instead of vulture, better supports and usage of charge for the phrygian cap). Check out the blazon's comments for a list of all current inaccuracies with the actual official shield.</q>
