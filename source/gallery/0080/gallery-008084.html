<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>God is the only person who is allowed to know things that should not be for him, because everything has to be accepted inside the human knowledge and the free state of thought. The same thing happens to things that are banned from the human knowledge, because it happens and makes sense when we believe that we shouldn't learn it and that makes sense. The human mind contains infinite varieties for the human being to learn and understand, which means it's very important for every living human and animal to have knowledge. Without it, nothing will exist.</q>
