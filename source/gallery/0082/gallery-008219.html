<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Arms for the newly formed University Engagement Team in my local police force designed by me. The 'mullet of eight' should be a Brunswick Star, and the bee would be properly balzoned as 'a Manchester Bee'. The fess represents the so-called 'Sillitoe tartan' (properly called dicing) of the police in the UK and the three books represent the three universities the team works with in the constabulary.</q>
