<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The two stars are for the second letter of the alphabet, B, and they're 12-pointed to represent vitamin B12. They're yellow to represent nooch, and they're on black to represent our deficiency.
The white and green seeblatts represent moral purity and the plants we eat.
The crown on the crest represents how much better we are than everyone else.
The lion represents that you wouldn't tell a lion to eat grass, and the boar represents how if we didn't eat animals, then they would eat us. The grass represents eating grass. "Quantum Potest et Practica" is what Google Translate told me "as Far as Possible and Practical" would be in Latin.

im vegan btw</q>
