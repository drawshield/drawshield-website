<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Yeah, yeah! I know! We shouldn't overlap gold and silver, two metals, but it can't be helped, I love the Sun and the Moon and since they are gold and silver, respectively, I'll overlap both! It's just so beautiful! – the church certainly won't be TOO furious since it is just the two lamps of the world (if you don't know, in the middle ages only the church could overlap gold and silver, no one else could do it and if you did, She... probably won't be happy about it).
