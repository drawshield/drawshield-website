<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Officially granted December 5th 1995, these arms are based on the oldest seals of the city from dating from 1320. The castle is the city, the river is the Elbe and the two escutcheon are that of Saxony in sinister and that of the Marshall of the Empire in  dexter. The city is closely associated with Martin Luther.</q>
