<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The chequers are from the arms of the Warennes, Earls of Surrey. The blue drops represent the tears of the fugitive Huguenots, many of whom settled in Wandswordth. The stars stand for the five parishes united in the Borouogh. The crosses link the arms with the arms of the city of London. The nebuly party line suggests the rivers Thames and Wandle. The dragon ship recalls the Danish inroads in the 9th century.</q>
