<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>This is the emblem of a custom carbine I built for a friend, a Marine colonel. The weapon is named Blackheart Six. Six was military radio code for a unit commander. His callsign was Blackheart, which sounds pirate like. His name is Roger, he smiled a lot when angry, so he was called "Jolly" Roger by his friends. That's a pirate thing. So, you can see the point of the blazon. In the real, instead of potenty, the background is Desert MARPAT and the 6 is "VI" . But, is a "6" when I'm written form, so, this works.</q>
