<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>This is my attempt at a recreation of the Ripperda coat of arms. The Ripperda family was a European noble house that produced many Soldiers, Politicians, and Diplomats throughout European history. Originally from The Netherlands, the family had branches in Germany, Spain, and Austria, with members being among the nobility of those countries.</q>
