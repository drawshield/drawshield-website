<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>"Polvijärvi" means "Knee Lake" in Finnish and therefore the chevron is a canting element "Polviorsi". The birds are actually geese and are depicted with their wings essorant but the closest charged I could find was "Swan Volant".

The arms were officially granted on September 10th 1953</q>
