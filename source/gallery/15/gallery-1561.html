<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>My attempt to Create the Delta rune from Toby Fox's Undertale. This Symbol is the Emblem of the Monster Kingdom that the Game takes place in and is found on Multiple Characters and environmental details, most notably on the Character Toriel's robes, and on the Stained Glass windows in the Last Corridor.

Sadly, there were some factors that had to be changed in order to fit in this platform. Notably, the Triangles are more closely aligned and between the wings there is a sphere, rather than a Cherub.  I could not find a spherical that could easily look like the Delta Rune, so I selected a cherub because it fit the themes and aesthetic of the emblem.

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy the emblem, and any comments and concerns would be apricated.  </q>
