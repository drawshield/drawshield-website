<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The current Altnau arms, with the ship crest, is for the descendants of Herman Altenau. These arms could be assigned (posthumously) to an earlier ancestor (possibly Johan Friedrich Altenau, or Wilhelm Altenau) so that other branches of the Altenau (Altnau) family would have a coat of arms as well.</q>
