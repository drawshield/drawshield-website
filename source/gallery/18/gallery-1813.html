<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Marshalling of an approximation of my family's arms (de Bouchard - 1st quarter), my personnal arms (du Lépreux, 2nd quarter), and some of my ancestors' (de Baillon - 3rd quarter, de Marles - 4th quarter).

Fun fact: I actually sewn and embroidered it as a hanging square flag, which I have used in medieval LARPing.</q>
