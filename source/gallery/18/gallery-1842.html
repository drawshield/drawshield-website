<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>deliberate errors due to limitations;
4th; bull has no horns, the crown is yellow ochre instead of or
6th; castle walls replaced with bridge
11th; mullets in annulo rather than surrounding the lion rampant
4th, 7th; eagles should have "wings charged with trefoil or" 
14th; instead of in thirds, the field is parted per pale and an enty added over quarters. One might also divide the field in chevron and divide the 1st filed after division per pale

escutcheon in shape of a square rather than a proper heater shield to prevent deforming</q>
