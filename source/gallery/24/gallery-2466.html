<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>One of the shields documented for the surename Araujo, or Arauxo, probably originated in the surroundings of Lobios, south of Galicia, northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, where a castle, Castelo de Arauxo, existed circa 12th - 15th centuries; it was destroyed almost completely, likely during the very remarkable Irmandi√±o revolts, along with other 130 castles of the galician nobility.</q>
