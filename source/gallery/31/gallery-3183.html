<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>This blazon was something I put together to represent a group of wizards in a fiction I'm writing. The goal was to figure out how to split a charge in to two colors and have eight symbols representing the schools of magic around that. I'm quite happy with how this one turned out. I've learned a lot about how this site works from making this flag.

Originally I was planning to have a Penrose Triangle at the center in place of the mascle, however, when I used per pale to split it in half, it did not split evenly (which threw off the symmetry of the background).</q>
