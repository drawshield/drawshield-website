<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>I was trying to have a river coming out of the mountains at sunset. I got the mountains and the sun fine. However, I couldn't find a good way to get a single river to leave the mountains (the closet I got was 'a shakefork wavy celestial-azure abased' to get two rivers merging into one, however, this design has the water start above the mountains even when the ordinary was abased). </q>
