<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The following, if applied to Line 8, would make more sense because the mullet is outside the fess and it would also make the mullet less transparent, not darker than the mullet in the dexter side pentagon. But for some reason the result of applying this blazoning to the crest is disastrous compared to the result of doing it directly to a main shield elsewhere.
