<h3>Notes</h3>
<q> this is obviously not a real flag of Ancient Greece  because  it was split into different city-states which all had their own banner.  Also that sort of variant edge type does not exist in heraldry, I just saw it in the visual catalogue and I got inspired to make a Greek-like flag,  or one that I would have imagined being used if there was such a thing as the Unified City-States of Ancient Greece.</q>
