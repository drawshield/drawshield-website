<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Arms of the Italian noble family Tomasi, whose most notable member is the 20th-century writer Giuseppe Tomasi, prince of Lampedusa, author of the novel "The Leopard" ("Il Gattopardo"),  an historical fiction set during the Risorgimento based on his own ancestors as implied by the title itself, the symbol of his family.

A cadet branch of the family, the Leopardi (likely named after the leopard in their coat of arms), gave birth to the 19-century poet Giacomo, widely regarded as the greatest Italian poet of his time.</q>
