<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>I used two non-heraldic versions to make this. I averaged and indexed the colors of the multi-colored charges using Photoshop, and I averaged the number of stars on the crown. I chose the Spanish shield shape because it can show the four stars while keeping the rounded bottom.</q>
