<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Marduc is an entirely fictional character for the RPG Pendragon. His grandfather Conan died falling down some stairs after being caught with another nobleman's wife. His father Cadoc died at the siege of Carlion, his first real engagement after several years of garrison duty. The tower refers to both. Marduc himself was knighted after his party slew a particularly vicious bear; Marduc himself got lost in the woods and only arrived when the bear was long dead. He did make sure to be the one to tell the tale of the group's exploits.</q>
