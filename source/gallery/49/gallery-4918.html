<pre>
    Per fess wavy gules and steel, an annulet countercharged
 slightly larger, a tactical symbol steel bendwise
 sinister in sinister chief very much larger
</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Properly, the arms should be "Per fess wavy gules and steel, an alchemical symbol for iron countercharged," but the alchemical symbol for iron available in Drawshield has different proportions compared to the images of Loppi's coat of arms I had seen.</q>
