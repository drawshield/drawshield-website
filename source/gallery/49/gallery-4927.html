    Azure, a mountain argent surmounted by two bars wavy
 azure, in chief three mullets of six points Or two
 and one, a bordure gules.

<p>With Tags: Slovenia</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Since the government doesn't have a blazon for it, I decided to make it based on the elements seen. Note that the bordure has a top, which doesn't appear on the official render.</q>
