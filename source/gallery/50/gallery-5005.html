<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Archbishop Chichele founded this college in 1437, six years before his death. The College uses the founderâ€™s arms; or, a chevron between three cinquefoils gules, which arms the Archbishop and his collateral descendants used, though the family was not previously armigerous, his father being a Northamptonshire yeoman. The College, which Chichele opened in the year of his death, was for a Warden and forty fellows, and, as they were enjoined to give themselves to prayer as well as learning, the College was called All Souls.</q>
