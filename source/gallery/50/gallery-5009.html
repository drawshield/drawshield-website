<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>This Society was originally a delegacy of the University and using the arms of the University with two differences : the words on the book have been changed to ‘Sapientia et Felicitate ‘ and there was a canton argent, charged with a Catherine wheel gules. Formerly another shield was used indiscriminately with the one mentioned, but this shield (gules, on a bend argent, three Catherine wheels of the field) is now used only by the Boat Club. Neither of these coats have been granted. The College is currently using the device here appended.</q>
