<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>founded in 1473, by Robert Woodlarke, Provost of King’s College : Gules a Catharine wheel or. The college has sometimes been credited with Woodlarke’s arms : per pale indented azure and gules, in chief a fleur-de-lis and in base a lion passant gardant both gold; and the Catharine wheel has been either impaled with this coat or placed above it as a crest. At the Visitation of 1684 the wheel alone was recorded as the arms of the college.</q>
