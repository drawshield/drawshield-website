<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Lady Margaret Hall, St. Hilda’s, St. Hugh’s and Somerville, are the four women’s colleges. L.M.H. was founded in 1878 and named after Henry VII.’s mother. It uses a coat of arms but has deliberately refrained from having it granted, on the grounds that all University Colleges are exempt from the Heralds’ authority by virtue of a charter of Henry IV., confirmed by Henry VIII, and cited successfully at the visitation of 1634. The arms used are “or, on a chevron between in chief two talbots passant (for Bishop Talbot one of the founders) and in base a bell azure (from the arms of Wordsworth, Dame Elizabeth Wordsworth being the first Principal) a portcullis of the field (for Lady Margaret Beaufort).”</q>
