<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>It's my imaginary Habsburg Netherlands coat of arms. Sable a lion or, represents Brabant region
Fleury azure and or with label represents County of Artois
Or a lion sable with riband gules represents County of Namur
Or a lion sable represents Flandres region
Or a lion gules represents County of Hainaut
Escutcheon in the center of the entire coat of arms is Habsburg Dynasty crest
There are also supporters:
A lion or- symbol of southern Netherlands
and an griffin sable- symbol of Austria-Hungary
Hope you like this coat of arms ;), making it took a lot of work.</q>
