<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>It isn't perfect recreation, for example in 2nd and 3nd quarters knight and horse should be in other position also knight should hold sword. The royal crown should be or-gules, but it is or-murrey. Supporters should "support" crest but they aren't and so on. Some of this mistakes or imperfections are caused by my little experience in this website and others by lack of it's functions. 
And sorry for mistakes in this description,  my English is bad</q>
