<p>To reproduce this image exactly you need to set your preferences to:</p>
<dl class="gallery-prefs" ><dt>Shield Shape</dt><dd>heater</dd>
<dt>Visual Appearance</dt><dd>none</dd>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>kinda wish that the crown was flat (didn’t have an opening) and also goes behind the blazon, maybe there should be an artist hint to make something go behind something... also wish that i didn’t have to make everything smaller and instead the image automatically zoomed out so it would show everything</q>
