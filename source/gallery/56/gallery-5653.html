</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The three acorns represent Mr and Mrs Middleton's three children (Catherine, Pippa and James). Acorns were chosen because the area in which the children were brought up - West Berkshire, England - is well wooded with oak trees. Additionally, oak is a long-established symbol of both England and strength.

The gold chevron, which sits at the centre of the design, refers to Mrs Carole Middleton, whose maiden name is Goldsmith. The two narrower chevrons, which sit either side of the gold chevron, allude to hills and mountains and represent outdoor pursuits that the family enjoy together.
