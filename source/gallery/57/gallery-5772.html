<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>My friend, science fiction fan Fred Isaacs, was once described as skipping down the corridor at a science fiction convention “like the bastard son of the Tooth Fairy”. Being Fred, he appeared at our Halloween party and the masquerade of the next convention costumed as the bastard son of the tooth fairy with these arms above his heart. He passed away recently, and I've blazoned his arms in his memory, adding the mantling and a crest and motto of my own devising. May he skip down the halls of eternity with the same panache as he did through life. Salute!</q>
