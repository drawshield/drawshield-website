<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>Creeper, aw man
So way back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swingin' from side to side (side to side)
This task a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight (night, night)
Diamonds tonight
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh no it's you again
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again (bolt again)
And run, run
Until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again (stuff again)
Just when you think you're safe
Overhearsome hissing from right behind (right behind)
That's a nice life you have
Shame it's got to end at this time, time, time, time
Blows up, and your health bar drops and you could use a 1-up
Get inside don't be tardy
So now you're stuck in there
Half a heart is left but don't die, die, die
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again (bolt again)
And run, run
Until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again (stuff again)
Creepers, ya mine, haha
Dig up diamonds, craft those diamonds, make some armor
Get it baby, go and forge that like you so, mlg pro
The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me bro
Ha, training in your room under the torch light
Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight
Every single day in the whole night
Creeper's out prowlin', (Whoo), alright
Look at me, look at you
Take my revenge that's what I'm gonna do
I'm a warrior baby, what else is new
And my blade's gonna tear through you
Bring it
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again
(Get your stuff, yea let's take back the world, haha)
Cause baby tonight
You grab your sword, armor and go (it's on)
Take your revenge (woo)
So fight, fight
Like it's the last, last
Night of your life, life show them your bite (woo)
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again (bolt again)
And run, run
Until it's done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn'
Cause baby tonight
The creeper's tryin' to steal all our stuff again (woo)</q>
