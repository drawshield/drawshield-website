<h3>Notes</h3>
<q>The shield bares the Cross of Saint Friedeswise which represents Oxfordshire. The book reading "Acts 11:24" refers to Saint Barnabas, a church dedicated to which stands in Horton and the raven clasping a breadloaf refers to Saint Benedict, a priory of whose order stands in Studley.</q>
