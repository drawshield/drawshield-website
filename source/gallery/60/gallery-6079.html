<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>The arms were officially granted on July 20, 1960.

The gold and white background is from the arms of Chertsey Abbey, which owned and is connected with the history of much of the district, Bagshot was included in a grant to the Abbey as early as 933. The stag's head refers to Bagshot Park, a royal demesne since Norman times and hunting ground of the Stuart kings, and also to the fact that much of the area was was formerly part of Windsor Forest. The grenade refers to the area's military associations, in particular the former military camp at Chobham and the lion recalls the area's royal links.

The fir cones and mound of heathland refers to Bagshot Heath, and the falcon is derived from the supporters of the Earls of Onslow.
