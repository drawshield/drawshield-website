<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>The crest should have a Rock Gules underneath the Griffin (which represents the sandstone cliff from which the town gets its name) but also includes a Cresset (a torch) to represent the area's former mining industry but it seems that the Crest can only have more than one charge only if it appears as "Charged with" another charge, so you'll just have to imagine the Griffin standing on a red stone! ;)</q>
