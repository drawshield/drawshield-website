    // This is number one (1) of the two official Coats
 //of Arms of the Mesquita family (i.e.: Bueno de Mesquita,
 // Gomes de Mesquita, etc) who fled Spain after 1492
 // due to persecutions of the Jews by the Spanish catholic
 // Inquisition and found refuge in Holland and later
 // Great Britain.
// The 5 Jewish Mesquita brothers fought on behalf
 // of the spanish King in approx the late 1480's against
 // the Mores/Muslim invasion and were able to counter
 // this invasion. The five brothers were rewarded, were
 // knighted are their CoA was drawn. //Later in history the Inquisition was started by
 the king's wife: The Jewish families fled as they
 did not want to convert to christianity. And by their
 refusal to convert, they were liable for the death-penalty,
 despite their loyalty to the king and their contributions
 to the kingdom.
