<h3>Notes</h3>


<q>Some licence taken with the arms of the House of Bernadotte for simplicity's sake: a simple bridge with three arches instead of a bridge with two towers, a lightning bolt fesswise because I couldn't get the thunderbolt to be displayed fesswise, a comet instead of the Great Dipper, because I couldn't be bothered.</q>
