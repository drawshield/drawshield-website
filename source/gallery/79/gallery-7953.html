<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>Taken from the Scottish Register of Tartans: "First illustrated in the 'Vestiarium Scoticum' this sett is known as the Cameron Clan tartan. The tartan was recorded by the City of Dunedin in Lord Lyon Public Register of all Arms & Bearings 36/86 on 25th November 1947. Scottish Tartans Society notes say that it may be derived from the tartan worn by the MacFees who also had a close association with Lochaber."</q>
