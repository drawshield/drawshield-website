<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>The escutcheon is supposed to shown a stag salient. There is no stag salient option on this website, but the stag rampant is very similar. I manually positioned the crown; I'm not sure if there's a better way to position it. The crest took some manual positioning too, and it's inspired by art I've seen of King Robert Baratheon during the Battle of the Trident, during which he kills Rhaegar Targaryen. In the battle, Robert wore a helmet with antlers, and Rhaegar wore a helmet with  dragon wings.</q>
