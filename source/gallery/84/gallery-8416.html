<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>Original blazon: Ar. a saltire sa. in base a holly leaf vert. Crest - A stag ppr. attired of ten tynes ar. lodged before a holly bush also ppr. Motto - Reviresco
Changed holly bush to a "Elder Sprig Fructed" due to lack of matching charges. Also stag lodged is lacking some of its tynes and unable to change their color.
