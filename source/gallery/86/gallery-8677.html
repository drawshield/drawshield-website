<h3>Blazon</h3>
<pre>
    sable, two chains shown much larger in saltire azure
 shown much larger , drawn in Spanish shape </pre>

<p>To reproduce this image exactly you need to set your preferences to:</p>
<dl class="gallery-prefs" ><dt>Shield Shape</dt><dd>heater</dd>
<dt>Visual Appearance</dt><dd>shiny</dd>
<dt>Palette For Heraldic Tinctures</dt><dd>drawshield</dd>
<dt>Aspect Ratio</dt><dd>0.5</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>I suspect there is a period way to express the "extending off the shield" aspect of the chains, rather than the hacky use of the "shown larger" extension. I don't know it, however.</q>
