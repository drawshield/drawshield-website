 gules, a cross argent, a bordure azure very much smaller.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>DrawShield refused to allow this shield as a flag because it has an inescutcheon in the blazon, and I can't make the arms of Savoy an English shield like in the actual flag because that would make it look wonky. Just enjoy it as it is until the site addresses these problems.</q>
