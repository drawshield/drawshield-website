<pre>
    gules, a fess or between three frogs vert
</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>Properly this should be blazoned "...three frogs proper," but as drawshield doesn't currently have a "proper" designation for frogs and the proper color is vert anyway, this seems reasonable.</q>

<p>If you would like to modify this blazon and see the effects <a href="http://drawshield.net/create/index.html?blazon=gules%2C%20a%20fess%20or%20between%20three%20frogs%20vert">click here</a> to copy it into the "create" page.</p>
