<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>"These are the proposed arms of the â€œsundered" nation of Le Pays d'Soleil en le Demiterres, an otherworldly nation ruled by the descendants of the real Louis XIV who was magically rescued after his brother imprisoned him as the man in the iron mask. I created it as a proposal for use by Earl Wajenberg, the author of the fantasy setting where the Pays d'Soleil and Grand Normandy (see #9884, and #9632 thru #9634)). I generally emblazon it on a French shield."
