<p>Suggested by an anonymous user, who adds:</p>

<q>Real, actual family arms: Gules A Lion passant guardant or A human heart argent in base. Our name derives from the welsh word for bear (or maybe hero), and our red shield with gold lion looks like several thousand similar. This is not only attractive, but unique; I've incorporated a very rare division augmentation (potenty), a very rare charge (Quarter sinister), and the rarest color (Purpure) in one design. Everyone will know exactly who's coming.</q>
