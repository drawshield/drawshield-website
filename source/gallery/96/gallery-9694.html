<p>Suggested by an anonymous user, who adds:</p>

<q>I combined the shields of the surnames of my parents, Cesar (my father) and Buffa (my mother). 
The elements from the Cesar shield are: 
 - the eagle argent in middle chief.
- the three orange crescents in a gules bar at the middle (in the original shield, they are seashells, but I used crescents because of the similarity)
The elements from the Buffa shield are:
- the background golden color
- the gules lion at the bottom</q>
