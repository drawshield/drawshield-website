<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>The escutcheon in 2nd quarter is supposed to be the same as the 3rd quarter, differenced with a sable mullet, which is to say "Or a cross gules between 16 alerions azure".
The canton on the escutcheon overall should be checky argent and azure; I replaced with semy de squares  because checky looked like quartered</q>
