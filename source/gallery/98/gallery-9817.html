<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>Navarre (4th quartering) is an approximation, still, but it's getting closer, I think.
I added Granada (enty in point simulated with a lozenge charge, because the ordinary obscured too much of Navarre) and the Anjou branch of the House of Bourbon (oval escutcheon simulated with two roundels)</q>
