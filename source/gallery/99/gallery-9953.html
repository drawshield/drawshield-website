<p><em>fleury vert and argent a bend  argent A eagle gules in dexter chief A eagle gules in fess point A eagle gules in sinister chief A lion dormant or in dexter base A crescent purpure in sinister base shown smaller than normal</em> suggested by LoLeatha:   "I personally choose this design based on my heritage African and British European and my ancestors came from and where they are today. I was hoping to use this crest as my permanent maternal grandfather's family crest. It was a very educational experience. I have been working our family crest for months."</p>
