<p>These arms were suggested by a DrawShield user, who provided the following additional information: </p>

<p><em>The arms of Mr Bernard C Martin, retired engineer. The crest is an open fetterlock emblem of tolerance, the chevron rompu a north country church gable. Cadences are in the arms of Professor Stephen Martin retired neuropsychiatrist with a label of 3 points ermine, of Mr Edward Martin deputy head teacher a label of 5 points ermine, of Mr Richard Martin spacecraft engineer and 2nd Lt British Army Reserve a label of a crescent.</em></p>

<p>If you would like to modify this blazon and see the effects <a href="http://drawshield.net/create/index.html?blazon=azure%20a%20chevron%20rompu%20or%20masoned%20sable%20in%20chief%20two%20roses%20argent%20barbed%20vert%20in%20base%20a%20martlet%20argent%20smaller%20and%20lower%20than%20normal">click here</a> to copy it into the "create" page. (The final drawing instructions are not part of the original blazon but position the martlett a little better given the rather large chevron rompu that DrawShield uses)</p>
