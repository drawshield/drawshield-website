<p>This example demonstrates that DrawShield can draw different edge types (about 20 variations altogether). 
These can be applied to most of the larger ordinaries and divisions. 
The <em>bars argent invected</em> against an <em>azure</em> field look a bit 
like vapour trails to me and I offer this suggestions to any pilots that may wish to register their own arms!</p>
