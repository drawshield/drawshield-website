        <p><em>Blazonry</em> is a special language, part English, part French, used to precisely describe the colours, shapes and objects that appear on a heraldic shield. There are several places to get help and information about DrawShield and the art of blazonry.</p>

        <h2>Drawshield User Guide</h2>

        <p>The <a href="/user-guide/" title="User Guide" target="">User Guide</a> shows you <a href="/user-guide/using-the-website-pages/" title="Using the Website Pages">how to use this website</a> as well containing a <a href="/user-guide/blazon-reference/" title="Blazon Reference"> complete reference</a> to all the terms that DrawShield can understand and a <a href="/user-guide/blazonry-tutorial/" title="Blazonry Tutorial">tutorial</a> on the language of Blazonry for those new to Heraldry. The <a href="/catalog/index.html" title="Visual Catalog">Catalog</a> shows thumbnail images of most of the
        things that DrawShield supports.</p>

        <h2>Other Information on Blazonry and Heraldry</h2>

        <p>If you would like to learn more about Blazonry and Heraldry there are many books available on the subject, almost all of which cover at least the basics of the blazon language. As well as the guide and tutorial mentioned above there is a good on-line <a href="http://heraldry.sca.org/armory/bruce.html" title="" target="_blank">Grammar of Blazonry</a> written by Bruce Miller of the <a href="http://sca.org/" title="" target="_blank">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>, most of which can be applied directly to <em>Drawshield</em>.</p>

        <h2>Looking For Your Family History or Coat of Arms?</h2>
