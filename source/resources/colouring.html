<p>Colouring books (or coloring books, if you are in North America) seem to be all the rage at the moment, so why should Heraldry be left out? I have put together a short down-loadable booklet of shield designs just right for colouring. There are nine different designs, plus a large blank shield and a page of smaller shields for practice. Please download the files from the links below. They are available under a Creative Commons, Attribution, Share-Alike, non-commercial licence, so they are free to use and distribute as many times as you like.</p>
