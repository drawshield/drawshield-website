<p>You can improve your blazoning skills by downloading and printing out the DrawShield Guide to Heraldry Poster! The poster was designed to be printed out around A3 portrait size (US "tabloid") size, although it will probably be readable at A4 / letter size. 
    There are two variations, the "Photo Printing" version has a DrawShield.net themed
background colour and would probably work best printed on photo paper. The "plain paper" version has a white background and should work best on normal paper. Obviously the poster doesn't really work if printed in monochrome...</p>
