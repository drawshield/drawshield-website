<p>We have already learnt about the <em>field</em> or background of the shield and know that we can give it a single <em>tincture</em> (colour), or split it into two parts, each with a different tincture. We will now look at another option for the field, that of using a <em>fur</em>.</p>

<p>Furs are so called because they are (highly stylised) representations of animal furs <sup>1</sup>. There are 3 basic furs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ermine (representing the fur of a small white mouse with a black tail, native to Armenia)</li>
	<li>Vair (origin obscure, but possibly representing skins of the small animal of the same name, stitched together)<sup>2</sup></li>
	<li>Potent (Like the head of a crutch but possibly just an even more stylised version of vair.) </li>
</ul>

<p>The image above shows the three basic furs, and in the 4th quarter a variant of <em>ermine</em> known as <em>pean.</em>. You can see the complete
set of available furs in the <a href="/catalog/treatments/furs/index.html">visual catalog</a>.</p>

<p>The important point to recognise with furs is that you use them as if
they were tinctures. Recall the first lesson, if we want a field (background) of ermine with a blue bend we would write <em>ermine a bend azure</em>.</p>

<p>In theory, you can use a fur instead of a plain tincture anywhere. This works well on the larger ordinaries, or in place of a single tincture in a divided shield, but smaller items and most charges will 
not work very effectively and should probably be avoided.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Rest assured that all furs used in DrawShield are artificial and no animals were harmed during the creation of the program.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. An interesting side note is that it was a mistranslation from French of <em>vair</em> as <em>verre</em>, or "glass" that turned
Cinderella's perfectly comfortable and sensible "Fur slippers" into uncomfortable and impractical "glass slippers"!</p>
