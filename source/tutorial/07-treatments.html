<p>We saw in the previous lesson that furs are simple repeating patterns with fixed colours. In heraldry there is also a much
wider range of repeating patterns available that can take any colours. DrawShield uses the term <em>treatment</em>
to refer to these patterns. For example, <em>fretty</em> is a pattern of interlocking lines that create a repeating
diamond shape. Since a treatment requires two colours, and we know that colours usually <strong>follow</strong> the
thing that they are describing you should not be surprised to find the pattern illustrated here to be described as:</p>

<p><em>fretty azure and or</em></p>

<p>Note that the first colour is the "background" colour and the second is the pattern. Where the treatment is more evenly
    split then the first colour is that which appears in the top left.
</p>

<p>As you gain familiarity with blazonry you will start to recognise common words with consistent meanings. You
have already seen the pattern called <em>fretty</em>, but there is a related charge called the <em>fret</em>, which
is a single "knot" of the <em>fretty</em>. In a similar fashion there are other treatments that are repeated patterns
of a single charge, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Annuletty</em> a pattern of repeated <em>annulets</em> (ring shapes)</li>
    <li><em>Mulletty</em> a pattern of repeated <em>mullets</em> (6 pointed stars)</li>
    <li><em>Billetty</em> a pattern of repeated <em>billets</em> (block shapes)</li>
    <li><em>Goutty</em> a pattern of repeated <em>gouttes</em> (tear drop shapes)</li>
    <li><em>Lozengy</em> a pattern of repeated <em>lozenges</em> (diamond shapes)</li>
</ul>


DrawShield supports most of the common treatments.
