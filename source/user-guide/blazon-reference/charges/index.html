<p>Drawshield supports some hundreds of charges, including all of the most common to be found in traditional Heraldry, and more are being added all the time. You can search the current list of charges using the box below, and view a thumbnail image. The thumbnail colours have no particular significance except to show those parts of the charge that can have a different tincture (for example, a tree may be <span class="keyword">trunked</span> and <span class="keyword">leaved</span>. The category pages below list most of the names of the features that can be coloured differently for each type of charge. It should also be noted that DrawShield recognises many alternative names and spelling variations for charges, the names here are those that I judge to be the most common.</p>

<p>I have also grouped the charges into categories below. These pages include extra information, such as the features that can be a different colour, modifiers that can change the way the charge is drawn and some of the alternative names.</p>
