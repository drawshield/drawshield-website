<p>Divisions are partitions of the field into separately
coloured sections. Some times the larger ordinaries or other charges are
also coloured using one of the simpler divisions, such as <span class="example">a roundel
per pale azure and or</span>. DrawShield supports the following
divisions.</p>

<h2>Divisions of Two Tinctures</h2>

<p>&quot;Large&quot; divisions - <span class="keyword">per pale, per fess, per bend,
per chevron, quarterly, per pile, per saltire</span></p>

<p>More &quot;pattern like&quot; divisions - <span class="keyword">barry, bendy, paly,
pily, fusily, chevronny, gyronny</span>, with most of these you can
also specify the number of &quot;bars&quot; e.g. <span class="example">barry of 8</span>,
<span class="example">gyronny of 12</span> etc.</p>

<p>There are also variants of the above, but with a fixed number of
&quot;bars&quot; - <span class="keyword">barry-bendy, barry-pily, fusily-bendy,
paly-bendy, pily-bendy, barry-indented-one-in-the-other</span>.</p>

<p>&quot;Smaller&quot; divisions - <span class="keyword">chape, chausse</span></p>

<p>Some authorities regard <span class="keyword">lozengy</span> as a division.
DrawShield handles lozengy as a <a href="treatments.html"
title="Treatments">treatment</a>, however the end result
appears identical when drawn.</p>

<h2>Divisions of Three Tinctures</h2>

<p>The following divisions need three tinctures to be provided, the
tinctures are typically given in the order top right and "clockwise"
around the shield - <span class="keyword">per pall, tierced-in-bend, tierced-in-fess,
tierced-in-pale, tierced-in-chevron</span></p>

<p>The division <span class="keyword">per pile</span> is rather special, as it can take
either two tinctures (in which the pile itself takes the 2nd tincture); or three
tinctures (in which the three parts are coloured from left to right).</p>

<h2>Edge Types</h2>

<p>All of the "larger" divisions may be drawn with a pattern along the
lines of separation, instead of a straight line. See the page on <a href="edges.html" title="Edges">edges</a> for more details. In
addition, there are two special divisions which have pattern edges only
along the named edge - <span class="keyword">quarterly-per-pale,
quarterly-per-fess</span></p>

<h2>Two Divisions</h2>

<p>It is also possible to have two different divisions on the same
shield, as long as the second division is described as
<span class="keyword">counterchanged</span>. The second division will overlay the
first, but with the colours reversed.</p>
