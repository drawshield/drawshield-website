<p>Instead of using straight edges to construct <a href="ordinaries.html" title="Ordinaries"
target="">ordinaries</a> or <a href="divisions.html" title="Divisions">divisions</a>, drawshield supports lines
with various patterns along them, for example <span class="example">a bend indented
or</span> draws a bend with small steps along each edge. The following
edge types can be drawn, most of which are shown in the accompanying
diagrams.</p> 

<img src="../img/Linetypes.png" alt=" Examples of Linetypes" class="img-fluid"/>

<p> <span class="keyword">Angled, dovetailed, escartelly, indented, invected, nowy,
potenty, raguly, embattled, embattled-arrondi, battled-embattled,
battled-brettesse, battled-counter-embattled, arched, double-arched
bevilled, dancetty, dancetty-floretty, nebuly, engrailed, rayonny, wavy,
urdy, twigged</span></p>

{% include findedge.html skipadd = true %}

<h2>Bars and Cotticing</h2>

<p>Ordinaries may also be cotticed, (surrounded with narrow bars), and
those cottices may also have an edge type, which may be different from
that of its "parent" ordinary.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you draw a number of bars, palets or bendlets, these
may also have their edge types specified. Indeed, you can use phrases
such as <span class="example">four bars gules, the outer ones wavy</span> to specify exactly
which bars should have which edge type.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The word <span class="example">potenty</span> can indicate either an edge type or a
treatment of two colours. DrawShield tries to choose between these
bylooking at the number of colours, thus <span class="example">a chief potenty or</span> is
a yellow chief with a edge made of "potent" shapes, while <span class="example">a chief
potenty azure and or</span> is a chief with a straight edge but coloured
in with a pattern of blue and yellow potent shapes.</p>
