<p>If you engage a human artist to create a coat of arms for you it is often a collaborative process. On being shown the first draft, you might say things like - "That's lovely, but can you make
the lion a bit larger and move it up a bit?". </p>

<p>The same dialogue is possible with DrawShield, using the "Artist Hints" extension. These are placed within the blazon itself and should follow whatever it is the hint
is about. Hints are introduced with the  keyword <span class="keyword">shown</span> (or, if you prefer your language more archaic, <span class="keyword">shewn somewhat</span>).
	So, in the example above, your blazon might contain something like <span class="keyword">a lion gules shown larger and slightly raised</span>.</p>

<p>You can give hints about charges, wherever they are used, and also about most parts of the achievement, including the shield itself. Note that the mantling, if it is present, is
	<em>always fixed</em> in size and position, all the other parts of the achievement are sized and positions relative to the mantling. If you want to adjust the position of the
shield itself then use <span class="keyword">the shield shown smaller</span> (or whatever) at the end of the achievement.</p>

<p>Artists hints can <em>not</em> be applied to ordinaries as these have fixed positions and sizes, however there are heraldic terms <span class="keyword">enhanced / abased</span>
which will move an ordinary upwards and downwards respectively. Similarly you cannot apply artistic hints to divisions or treatments, these are always drawn in fixed positions.</p>

<p>The list of available hints, and there effect is as follows:</p>


	<p class="lead">To make charges smaller: </p>
<ul>
			<li><span class="keyword">slightly smaller</span> - the charge will be shown about 90% of the normal size</li>
			<li><span class="keyword">smaller</span> - the charge will be shown about 80% of the normal size</li>
			<li><span class="keyword">much smaller</span> - the charge will be shown about 60% of the normal size</li>
			<li><span class="keyword">very much smaller</span> - the charge will be shown about 40% of the normal size</li>

</ul>
<p class="lead">To make charges larger: </p>
<ul>
		<li><span class="keyword">slightly larger</span> - the charge will be shown about 10% larger than usual</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">larger</span> - the charge will be shown about 20% larger than usual</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">much larger</span> - the charge will be shown about 40% larger than usual</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">very much larger</span> - the charge will be shown about 60% larger than usual</li>

</ul>		
<p class="lead">To rotate charges: </p>
<ul>
		<li><span class="keyword">rotated to the dexter</span> - The charge will be rotated anti-clockwise (i.e. towards the top left).</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">slightly rotated to the dexter</span> - The charge will be rotated anti-clockwise, but not quite as much .</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">much rotated to the dexter</span> - The charge will be rotated anti-clockwise, but a bit further round.</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">very much rotated to the dexter</span> - The charge will be rotated anti-clockwise, but a quite a bit further round.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the terms <span class="keyword">clockwise / anti-clockwise / counter-clockwise</span> if this clearer to you.</p>

<p>Obviously you can also use <span class="keyword">sinister</span> in place of <span class="keyword">dexter</span> to rotate in the opposite direction. You can also use constructions like <span class="keyword">turned towards the sinister</span> if that reads better.</p>
<p>The rotations are in steps of 9 degrees, so <span class="keyword">slightly rotated</span> is 9 degrees, and <span class="keyword">very much rotated</span> is 36 degrees. Do <b>NOT</b> use multiple rotations when you really mean <span class="keyword">bendwise</span> or <span class="keyword">bendwise sinister</span>.</p>

<p class="lead">To move the charge upwards:</p>
<ul>	<li><span class="keyword">slightly raised</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/40th of the shield height upwards</li>
<li><span class="keyword">raised</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/20th of the shield height upwards</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">much raised</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/10th of the shield height upwards</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">very much raised</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/5th of the shield height upwards</li></ul>
    <p class="lead">To move the charge downwards:</p>
		<ul>	<li><span class="keyword">slightly lowered</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/40th of the shield height downwards</li>
		<li><span class="keyword">lowered</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/20th of the shield height downwards</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">much lowered</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/10th of the shield height downwards</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">very much lowered</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/5th of the shield height downwards</li></ul>
	<p class="lead">To move the charge sideways:</p>
	<ul>	<li><span class="keyword">slightly to the sinister</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/40th of the shield weight to the sinister side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">to the sinister</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/20th of the shield weight to the sinister side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">much to the sinister</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/10th of the shield weight to the sinister side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">very much to the sinister</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/5th of the shield weight to the sinister side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">slightly to the dexter</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/40th of the shield width to the dexter side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">to the dexter</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/20th of the shield width to the dexter side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">much to the dexter</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/10th of the shield width to the dexter side of the shield</li>
	<li><span class="keyword">very much to the dexter</span> - the charge will be moved about 1/5th of the shield width to the dexter side of the shield</li></ul>
	<p class="lead">Repitition:</p>
	<ul>	<li><span class="keyword">shown likewise</span> - the same set of adjustments that were applied most recently will also be applied to this charge</li>
</ul>

<p>The word <span class="keyword">slightly</span> can be replaced by <span class="keyword">a little</span> if you prefer.</p>

<p class="lead">To adjust spacing between multiple charges you can use the largely self-explanatory terms: </p>
<ul>
			<li><span class="keyword">closer together</span></li>
			<li><span class="keyword">much closer together</span></li>
			<li><span class="keyword">very much closer together</span> - In some cases charges may overlap</li>
			<li><span class="keyword">further apart</span></li>
			<li><span class="keyword">much further apart</span></li>
			<li><span class="keyword">very much further apart</span> - In some cases charges may extend beyond the edge of the shield</li>
</ul>

<p>Note you should avoid using <em>closer together</em> when you really mean <em>conjoined</em>, which is a true heraldic term. Nor should you use
repeated positioning hints when you really just mean something like <span class="keyword">in first quarter</span> or one of the other heraldic positions
on the field.</p>

<p>You may also use additional words and phrases like <span class="keyword">than the usual</span> or <span class="keyword">than is normal</span>, which don't have any effect but might make your blazon clearer.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><span class="example">Argent a mullet vert shown somewhat larger than the normal</span> (or, more concisely) <span class="example">Argent a mullet vert shown larger</span></p>

<p><span class="example">Argent a crescent gules shown much smaller and raised from the usual</span></p>

<p>You can also do non-heraldic but interesting things like stacking multiple charges neatly: <span class="example">Argent a mullet vert shown somewhat larger than the normal a mullet or a mullet gules shown smaller a mullet azure shown much smaller</span></p>

<h2>Fine control</h2>

<p>It is possible to repeat these hints and each will applied in turn, <strong>however</strong> it is strongly recommended to use the <span class="keyword">much</span> modifiers rather than repeating the adjustment. Not only does this look grammatically nicer, the "effect" of a <span class="keyword">much</span> is actually greater than repeating the "basic" modifier. Consider the following examples:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>A roundel or smaller smaller smaller</dt><dd>size multiplier = 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512</dd>
	<dt>A roundel or very much smaller</dt><dd>size multiplier = 0.4</dd>
	<dt>A roundel or to the sinister to the sinister to the sinister</dt><dd>Movement = 1/20th + 1/20th + 1/20th = 3/20th (0.15)</dd>
	<dt>A roundel or very much to the sinister</dt><dd>Movement = 1/5th (0.2)</dd>
</dl>

<p>However, if you want absolutely fine control and don't mind how ugly your blazon you can do things like: <span class="example">a roundel or very much smaller larger</span>, which will use a size multiplier of 0.4 * 1.2 = 0.48, a value not achievable directly.</p>
