<p>On the Create Menu there is an extra panel that can be opened which allows you to set various visual options about how the shield is drawn. These are described in <a href="/user-guide/create-page/01-options.html"> more detail here.</a> In addition to setting options using the form there is also a facility to specify these options by a  extension to the blazon itself.</p>

<p>Options are introduced by the word <span class="keyword">drawn</span>, which <em>MUST</em> come after all other the parts of the blazon. Options set in the blazon override those set on the create page.</p>

<p>Note that options set by using the <span class="keyword">drawn</span> keyword in the blazon are <em>NOT</em> reflected in the "Drawing Options" form and hence are <em>NOT</em> saved between sessions. The advantage of using options set in the blazon itself is that they are easier to store and pass around.</p>

<h2>Setting a Visual Effect</h2>

<p>To set the visual effect (actually an SVG filter) which changes the overall appearance of the shield you can say for example <span class="example">drawn with a stonework appearance</span>, or <span class="example">drawn in a shiny style</span>. The available effects are <span class="keyword">(plain, flat, none), (stone, stony, stonework), (plaster, plasterwork), (vellum, leather), (metal, shiny)</span>, where the brackets indicate words with the same meaning.</p>

<h2>Using a Colour Palette</h2>

<p>Heraldry has no set colours for tinctures, they are left to the discretion of the herald. DrawShield allows you to select from a number of colour "palettes". This is done by using a construction such as <span class="example">drawn with wikipedia tinctures</span> or <span class="example">drawn in emoji colours</span>.  The available palettes are <span class="keyword">drawshield (the default), emoji, wikipedia, wappenwiki, bajuvarian, nocolour</span>. With the "Nocolour" palette all tinctures except for black and gray are drawn white. This is useful if you want to create images for colouring later.</p>

<h2>Setting the Shield Shape</h2>

<p>It is also possible to chose the overall shape of the shield, using the construction <span class="example">drawn in a XXXXXX shape</span>, where XXXXX is one of the words <span class="keyword">default, heater, French, Oval, Lozenge, square,  Italian, Swiss, English, German, Polish, Spanish.</span>. The corresponding shapes are shown below:</p>

<p>The heater shape is used by default, unless the shield contains 8 or more subshields, in which case the French shape is used.</p>

<img src="/user-guide/extensions/img/shield-shapes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Shield Shapes" />

<p>All shapes can be correctly given a <span class="keyword">bordure</span> but almost everything else that relies on the shape of the shield probably won't work, and there are likely to be many times in which placements and arrangements put charges that overlap the edges or show other strange effects, you may find the <a href="/user-guide/extensions/charge-adjustments.html"> charge adjustments extension</a> helpful in these cases.</p>

<p>In addition to the heraldic shield shapes shown here, there are shapes that trigger additional extensions, see  <a href="/user-guide/extensions/flag.html">the flags extension</a> and the
    <a href="/user-guide/extensions/pauldron.html">Warhammer Pauldrons extension.</a></p>

<p>Options can be combined, for example <span class="example">drawn in a plain style and in emoji colours</span></p>
