<h2>Creating Fabric Patterns.</h2>

<p>The code that creates normal heraldic treatments is very flexible and was easily modified to produce fabric like patterns.
Although not remotely Heraldic they are included here in the hope that they might be useful for something. You can if you
want to use them as the field for your arms but heraldic purists are unlikely to be happy about it!</p>

<h3>Plaid Patterns</h3>

<p>These patterns are based on those illustrated and discussed on this <a href="https://www.plaidlover.com/different-types-plaid-pattern/">
    Plaid Lovers</a> page. The patterns available are <strong>buffalo check, gingham, glen check</strong>
    (or <strong>Prince of Wales check</strong>),
    <strong>graph check, houndstooth</strong> and
    <strong>shepherd check</strong>. </p>

<p>These work exactly the same way as treatments and must be followed by two tinctures.</p>

<p>To see the appearance of these patterns look at the <a href="/catalog/treatments/fabric/index.html">visual catalog page.</a></p>


<h3>Tartan Patterns</h3>

<p>Tartan patterns don't really fall into the heraldic way of doing things but it seemed a shame not to implement so I have
    added a small extra piece of syntax to allow them to be drawn. The implementation here is based on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan#Construction">Wikipedia discussion here</a>, with additional
    information from <a href="https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/">the official Scottish Tartan Register</a>.</p>

    <p>The pattern name is (obviously) <em>tartan</em> and this
should be followed by a series of colour names and thread widths. (Note that <strong>only</strong> colours may be used, not any
other type of tincture). Thread widths are given as numbers. You should assume that there are 500 threads across the field, hence
if your total thread widths add up to 50 your pattern will repeat 5 times across the full width. (Each pattern is 100 x 100 threads
        because of the mirrored repeat). So, for example:</p>
.
<p><em>tartan ancient black 4 scarlet 24 ancient black 24 yellow 4</em></p>

<p>Produces the rather lovely pattern:</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/user-guide/extensions/img/tartan1.png" alt="Tartan swatch" />

<p>Note that using the tartan pattern will <em>automatically enable</em> the extra tartan colour set. You can use as many
colour / thread count pairs as required, at least 4 for a proper "tartan" appearance.
	If required, a semi-colon can be used to separate the tartan description from any following
content, and commas may be used between each item. You are not limited to tartan colours, but can use any of the colour sets
that you have enabled (see below).</p>

<p>The referenced sources both mention rare cases in which the tartan pattern does <strong>not</strong> repeat in a mirror
image. For this situation use the construction <em>tartan no repeat</em> followed by the colours and thread counts
as normal.</p>

<p>In general, if you find published thread counts you can probably use them "as is" - although you
    will need to convert the abbreviations to proper colour names. A convertor for this process is provided below, (and may be
incorporated into the main DrawShield code later):</p>

<script src="tartan.js" ></script>
		<form>
			<div class="form-group">
				<p>Converts standard tartan descriptions into a form usable by DrawShield</p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label class="description" for="tartan">Tartan  Specification </label>
				<input id="tartan" name="tartan" class="form-control" type="text" maxlength="255" value=""/>
				<p class="guidelines" id="guide_1"><small>Enter tartan components e.g. K4 R24 K24 Y4</small></p>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group">
				<label class="description" for="blazon">DrawShield Blazon </label>
				<textarea id="blazon" name="blazon" class="form-control"></textarea>
			</div>
			<div class="form-group row">
				<div class="col">
					<input onclick="tartanToBlazon();" class="button_text" type="button" name="submit" value="Convert" />
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<input onclick="tartanToBlazon();" class="button_text" type="reset" name="reset" value="Clear" />
				</div>
			</div>
		</form>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The colour mixing that occurs when threads "overlap" is very crude and not based on any physically realistic process.
I might change this in the future if anyone reports it to be a problem.</p>

<h3>Tattersall Pattern</h3>

<p>The Plaid Lover's site referenced above also includes a fabric pattern known as <em>Tattersall</em>. This has 3 colours
so doesn't really fit into the heraldic treatment paradigm,however it can be simulated by using the tartan pattern - the
photograph on the plaid lover's can be simulated by entering <em> tartan gules 3 argent 36 brunatre 3</em>.</p>

<h3>Additional Colours</h3>

<p>For fabric design purposes you may find it useful to turn on the additional colour sets <em>named wed</em> and <em>tartan</em>
as <a href="/user-guide/extensions/extra-colours.html">discussed here</a>. As noted above, using the tartan pattern automatically
enables the tartan colour set.</p>

<h3>Visual Appearance</h3>

<p>Since these patterns are not really heraldic it may not seem appropriate to display on a shield. As an alternative
you may wish to the shape <em>swatch</em>, which is chosen from the drop-down <strong>Preferences</strong> pane
and is intended to look like a material sample. Alternatively you can append <em>drawn using the swatch shape</em> to the
end of the blazon</p>

<p>In addition, there is a visual effect which can be applied, specifically created for these patterns, <em>Fabric</em>. This
can also be selected from the drop-down <strong>Preferences</strong> menu, or by appending <em>drawn using the fabric effect</em> to
the end of the blazon. Note that this effect darkens the colours somewhat, so may always be suitable, but it does like nice, especially
on tartans, which are very subdued anyway.</p>
